//! The snapshots received so far and the model time the viewer shows.
//!
//! [`Playback`] keeps the solver's snapshots in arrival order, dropping the oldest
//! beyond a memory budget (counted in the bytes held: snapshots grow with their
//! particles), and a clock that runs `rate` seconds of model time per
//! second. The clock never passes the newest snapshot: while the solver is behind, the
//! view waits for it. Between two snapshots the field is interpolated linearly in
//! time ([`crate::field::Field`]). A replay ([`Source::Replay`]) sends the frames of a
//! finished run down the same channel.
//!
//! A snapshot file is read on demand instead ([`OnDemand`], `crate::replay::serve`):
//! the playback knows every frame's time from the start, asks the reading thread for
//! the two frames around the shown time and the next one, and holds only those
//! ([`HELD`]), so a run of any length plays and seeks within a few megabytes. The
//! gauge trace's samples of every frame arrive beside them ([`Playback::series`]). A
//! file a run is still writing grows as new frames appear; the clock stops at the
//! newest, as it waits for a running solver.
//!
//! Keys: Space pauses, `[` and `]` halve and double the rate, ← and → step back and
//! forward by ten snapshots, Home and End jump to the oldest and newest.
