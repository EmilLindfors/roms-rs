//! The land and the sea bed around the model domain, from elevation models, so that
//! the domain sits in its map instead of a cut-out block.
//!
//! An elevation model is a north-up longitude/latitude GeoTIFF of bed elevations with
//! land heights (Kartverket's topobathy model from `scripts/kartverket_topobathy.sh`;
//! `--terrain`), placed by the scenario's projection ([`Scenario::projection`]). The
//! first is the base: its exact-zero holes are filled as the solver's runs fill them
//! (`BedRaster::fill_holes`), and it is sampled bilinearly on a regular grid at its
//! resolution (coarser if that would exceed [`MAX_VERTICES`]) over the mesh's box and
//! a margin around it (`--terrain-margin`).
//!
//! Further models are finer patches over it, such as the service's 1 m level around a
//! farm: lidar land, and a flat 0 over the sea it has not surveyed. Where a patch has
//! land (or a surveyed depth) it replaces the coarser models; its exact 0 is the water
//! surface, and takes their depth there, capped at 0. Each patch is its own grid,
//! aligned to the base grid's lines with a whole number of its cells in each of the
//! base's, which are cut out under it; its border vertices follow the base's edges, so
//! the seam has no cracks. Patches should not overlap one another.
//!
//! The model draws its own bed and water ([`crate::surface`]), so the terrain stops at
//! the mesh boundary: cells wholly inside are left out, and the inside corners of the
//! cells across the boundary snap onto it (its nearest point). There the terrain takes
//! the land's height, the elevation model's or the model's bed where that is higher,
//! and the model's bed rises to it in a wall along the boundary ([`Terrain::coast`]):
//! the coast the model has. The wall matters: the coastline mesh's walls stand in deep
//! water (within a cell of the boundary the model's bed is −17 m at the 10th percentile
//! against +16 m land outside, at Frøya), and grid cells sloping across it instead
//! drew a row of teeth around every island.
//!
//! Land the mesh does not resolve is drawn inside it too: where the elevation model
//! stands [`LAND_CLEARANCE`] above both mean sea level and the model's bed, as islets
//! a coarse mesh floods (around the Kattholmen farm the Frøya mesh has water over
//! every skerry). The inside vertices beside it keep the elevation model's height
//! down to [`SHORE_DEPTH`], so the land slopes into the model's water at its real
//! coastline and stops just under it; the model's bed is the sea floor. Sunk under the
//! model's bed (tens of metres deep on a coarse element there), every coast hung a
//! curtain one cell wide; at the elevation model's own depth, a 50 m cell with one
//! land corner hung an icicle under each skerry. That hides the model's water over
//! such land: it is a map of the coast, not of the model's.
//!
//! Land is coloured by height ([`LAND`]), the sea bed on the model bed's depth scale
//! ([`BedScale`]), so the colours run on across the model's open boundaries. The sea
//! outside the model is still and flat at mean sea level, but on the mesh boundary,
//! where it meets the model's water at the surface there (so the two join within a
//! cell at open boundaries instead of a step of the tide's height): a plain tint, as
//! translucent as the model's water and hidden with it, so the model's coloured water
//! stands out in it. L toggles the terrain.
//!
//! In the photo view ([`crate::photo`]) the ground is seen through the still sea
//! over it (its depth below mean sea level in UV 1), and the sea carries the waves.
