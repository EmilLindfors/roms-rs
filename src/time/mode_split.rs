//! Mode-split time integration for 3D ocean models.
//!
//! Separates the fast barotropic (2D) mode from the slow baroclinic (3D) mode.
//!
//! # Method
//!
//! One baroclinic step `tⁿ → tⁿ⁺¹ = tⁿ + Δt` (Shchepetkin & McWilliams 2005, with
//! SSP-RK3 in place of their forward-backward barotropic stepping):
//!
//! 1. **Slow forcing.** The horizontal 3D momentum tendency `R₃D` at `tⁿ`
//!    ([`ModeSplitPhysics::momentum_rhs_into`]) and, from it, the slow forcing
//!    `Gⁿ` of the barotropic transport ([`ModeSplitPhysics::slow_forcing_into`]).
//!    The pass uses the average of `G` over the step, extrapolated from
//!    `Gⁿ, Gⁿ⁻¹, Gⁿ⁻²` (AB3 with variable steps; [`step_average_weights`]).
//! 2. **One barotropic pass.** The 2D shallow-water module steps the transport
//!    `(h, hu, hv)` plus `G` with SSP-RK3 substeps of `Δt/n_bt` over
//!    `[tⁿ, tⁿ + M*·Δt/n_bt]`, `M* ≈ 1.3·n_bt`. `n_bt` follows from the 2D CFL
//!    every step. The substep states are averaged with the power-law weights of
//!    [`BarotropicFilter`], centred on `tⁿ⁺¹`; the average `(η̄, D̄ū)` is the new
//!    barotropic state, with `ū = D̄ū / D̄`. The fluxes of every RK stage are
//!    accumulated with the secondary weights into the transport that moved
//!    `η` over the step, `η̄ − ηⁿ = −Δt·∇·DU_avg2` ([`BarotropicTransport`]).
//!    Rivers ([`ModeSplitPhysics::rivers`]) add their discharge to every
//!    stage and are averaged the same way, `+ Δt·Q̄/A_k` in their elements
//!    (see [`crate::source::river`]). After the 2D RHS, each stage's work
//!    (`+ G`, the combination, the drag, the sums) is one element-block
//!    pass.
//! 3. **3D stages.** SSP-RK3 on the 3D fields, with the velocity and the
//!    tracers stepped as inventories `H_z u`, `H_z C` and divided by the new
//!    `H_z` at the end of the step. `η, ū, v̄` get the constant rates of the
//!    pass, `(η̄ − ηⁿ)/Δt` etc.; SSP-RK3 reproduces a constant-rate solution
//!    exactly, so each stage sees the barotropic state linearly interpolated
//!    to its stage time. In every stage the column sum of the momentum
//!    tendency is replaced by the constant rate of the barotropic transport,
//!    `(D̄ūⁿ⁺¹ − Dⁿūⁿ)/Δt`, shared out by `Δσ_l`, so the depth mean of `u` is
//!    `ūⁿ⁺¹` at the end. Stage 1 reuses the `R₃D` of step 1. The terms that
//!    move with the layer volume fluxes
//!    ([`ModeSplitPhysics::transport_rhs_into`]: momentum and tracer
//!    advection) get the pass's `DU_avg2` and `∂η/∂t`, so that the layers
//!    carry exactly the water the free surface moved: constancy and
//!    conservation of the tracers and of the layer momentum (see
//!    [`crate::solver::rhs::transport_3d`]). The turbulence of a prognostic
//!    closure (`Solution3D::tke`, `gls`, at the w-points) is carried the
//!    same way, as inventories over the w-cells
//!    ([`crate::solver::rhs::w_cell_thicknesses`]).
//! 4. **Implicit vertical terms** (diffusion with the surface and bottom
//!    stresses), then the depth mean of `u` is reset to `ū`.
//!
//! A bottom drag `τ_b/ρ₀ = r·u_b` ([`ModeSplitPhysics::bottom_drag_into`])
//! is linearised with `r` frozen at `tⁿ`. Its depth-mean part `−r·ū` is
//! applied point-implicitly in every barotropic RK stage, like the 2D
//! friction, so no `r·Δt/D` destabilises it; `G` carries the part of the
//! vertical shear, `−r·(u_b − ū)`, and the vertical diffusion takes
//! `r·u_bⁿ⁺¹` as its bottom flux. A drag within the column (net cages,
//! `−λ_l u_l` on layer `l`, [`ModeSplitPhysics::layer_drag_into`]) is
//! treated the same way: `−Λ̄ ū` with `Λ̄ = Σ_l Δσ_l λ_l` in the pass,
//! `−D Σ_l Δσ_l λ_l (u_l − ū)` in `G`, `−λ_l u_lⁿ⁺¹` in the vertical solve.
//!
//! The 2D positivity limiter and wet/dry treatment run after every barotropic
//! RK stage (and on the filtered state, since the filter has small negative
//! weights), and stiff 2D damping (implicit friction) is applied per stage, as
//! in [`crate::simulation::Simulation`].
//!
//! # Division of labour
//!
//! The 2D module owns the depth-mean flow: the barotropic pressure gradient
//! (with the DG face coupling of `η`), advection of `ū`, Coriolis on `ū` and
//! its own bottom friction (none when the 3D model has a bottom drag, whose
//! depth-mean part the splitter applies). `G` carries only what depends on
//! the vertical structure: the baroclinic pressure gradient, the momentum
//! dispersion of the vertical shear and the surface/bottom stresses of the 3D
//! columns (see [`crate::physics::Hydrostatic3D`]).
//!
//! # Accuracy and known gaps (TODO P4.1)
//!
//! - The slow coupling is third order (AB3 step average of `G`).
//! - The filter adds almost no damping to resolved barotropic motion
//!   (≈ 0.03 % amplitude per period at 50 baroclinic steps per period; see
//!   [`BarotropicFilter`]). Strictly this term is first order, with a
//!   constant ≈ 1e-3 of the usual one.
