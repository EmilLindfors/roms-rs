//! Mode-split time integration for 3D ocean models.
//!
//! Separates the fast barotropic (2D) mode from the slow baroclinic (3D) mode.
//!
//! # Method
//!
//! One baroclinic step `tⁿ → tⁿ⁺¹ = tⁿ + Δt` (Shchepetkin & McWilliams 2005, with
//! SSP-RK3 in place of their forward-backward barotropic stepping):
//!
//! 1. **Slow forcing.** The 3D RHS `R₃D` at `tⁿ` and, from it, the slow forcing
//!    `Gⁿ` of the barotropic transport ([`ModeSplitPhysics::slow_forcing_into`]).
//!    The pass uses the average of `G` over the step, extrapolated from
//!    `Gⁿ, Gⁿ⁻¹, Gⁿ⁻²` (AB3 with variable steps; [`step_average_weights`]).
//! 2. **One barotropic pass.** The 2D shallow-water module steps the transport
//!    `(h, hu, hv)` plus `G` with SSP-RK3 substeps of `Δt/n_bt` over
//!    `[tⁿ, tⁿ + M*·Δt/n_bt]`, `M* ≈ 1.3·n_bt`. `n_bt` follows from the 2D CFL
//!    every step. The substep states are averaged with the power-law weights of
//!    [`BarotropicFilter`], centred on `tⁿ⁺¹`; the average `(η̄, D̄ū)` is the new
//!    barotropic state, with `ū = D̄ū / D̄`. The fluxes of every RK stage are
//!    accumulated with the secondary weights into the transport that moved
//!    `η` over the step, `η̄ − ηⁿ = −Δt·∇·DU_avg2` ([`BarotropicTransport`]).
//! 3. **3D stages.** SSP-RK3 on the 3D fields. In every stage the depth mean of
//!    the velocity tendency is replaced by the constant rate `(ūⁿ⁺¹ − ūⁿ)/Δt`,
//!    and `η, ū, v̄` get the same constant rates. SSP-RK3 reproduces a
//!    constant-rate solution exactly, so each stage sees the barotropic state
//!    linearly interpolated to its stage time, and the depth mean of `u` stays
//!    equal to `ū`. Stage 1 reuses the `R₃D` of step 1.
//! 4. **Implicit vertical terms** (diffusion with the surface and bottom
//!    stresses), then the depth mean of `u` is reset to `ū`.
//!
//! The 2D positivity limiter and wet/dry treatment run after every barotropic
//! RK stage (and on the filtered state, since the filter has small negative
//! weights), and stiff 2D damping (implicit friction) is applied per stage, as
//! in [`crate::simulation::Simulation`].
//!
//! # Division of labour
//!
//! The 2D module owns the depth-mean flow: the barotropic pressure gradient
//! (with the DG face coupling of `η`), advection of `ū`, Coriolis on `ū` and
//! its own bottom friction. `G` carries only what depends on the vertical
//! structure: the baroclinic pressure gradient, the momentum dispersion of the
//! vertical shear and the surface/bottom stresses of the 3D columns (see
//! [`crate::physics::Hydrostatic3D`]).
//!
//! # Accuracy and known gaps (TODO P4.1)
//!
//! - The slow coupling is third order (AB3 step average of `G`).
//! - The filter adds almost no damping to resolved barotropic motion
//!   (≈ 0.03 % amplitude per period at 50 baroclinic steps per period; see
//!   [`BarotropicFilter`]). Strictly this term is first order, with a
//!   constant ≈ 1e-3 of the usual one.
//! - `R₃D` is still evaluated into a freshly allocated state (TODO P4.5).
