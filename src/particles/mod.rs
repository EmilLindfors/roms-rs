//! Lagrangian particle tracking in the depth-averaged flow (TODO F.2), and
//! in the 3D flow with a σ-level per particle ([`tracker_3d`]), where
//! particles can swim by a behaviour ([`behaviour`]: salmon-lice larvae).
//!
//! Particles (sea-lice larvae, feed, faeces, drifters) move with a velocity
//! field sampled from the DG solution at the particle itself: the element
//! polynomial evaluated at the particle's reference coordinates, not the
//! nearest node ([`ParticleVelocity2D`]).
//!
//! # Advection
//!
//! A step from `t` to `t + Δt` integrates `dx/dt = u(x, t)` with the classical
//! fourth-order Runge–Kutta method:
//!
//! ```text
//! k₁ = u(xⁿ, t),              k₂ = u(xⁿ + ½Δt k₁, t + ½Δt),
//! k₃ = u(xⁿ + ½Δt k₂, t + ½Δt),   k₄ = u(xⁿ + Δt k₃, t + Δt),
//! xⁿ⁺¹ = xⁿ + Δt/6 (k₁ + 2k₂ + 2k₃ + k₄) + √(2KΔt) ξ,
//! ```
//!
//! so a field that the elements represent exactly (e.g. solid-body rotation,
//! linear in x and y, on bilinear elements of any order) is followed to the
//! RK4 error, O(Δt⁴) over a fixed time. Between two snapshots
//! ([`SWEVelocity2D::between`]) the velocity is linear in time, the usual
//! offline practice (OpenDrift, LADiM); the error of that interpolation is
//! then the output interval's, not the step's.
//!
//! # Dispersion
//!
//! With a horizontal diffusivity `K`, each step adds an independent Gaussian
//! displacement `√(2KΔt) ξ`, `ξ ~ N(0, I₂)` (the Itô form of
//! `∂c/∂t = ∇·(K∇c)` for constant `K`). Reflection at walls keeps a uniform
//! areal distribution uniform (Visser 1997's well-mixed condition in 2D).
//! This is the dispersion of a surface or depth-uniform concentration; a
//! depth-integrated tracer (`∂(hc)/∂t = ∇·(hK∇c)`) also needs the drift
//! `K∇h/h` (Dimou & Adams 1993), which is not implemented. A `K` that varies
//! in space (a field of the flow's, e.g. Smagorinsky's from the model's own
//! viscosity) adds the drift `∇K Δt` and is added to the tracker's constant
//! ([`diffusivity`]: [`WithHorizontalDiffusivity2D`],
//! [`WithHorizontalDiffusivity3D`]).
//!
//! Each particle draws its random numbers from its own SplitMix64 stream,
//! seeded by the tracker's seed and the particle's id, so a run is
//! reproducible whatever the thread count or particle order.
//!
//! # Stokes drift
//!
//! [`WithStokesDrift2D`] and [`WithStokesDrift3D`] add the waves' Stokes drift
//! ([`crate::waves::StokesDriftField`]) to any flow, at a fixed depth in 2D and
//! at each particle's depth in 3D ([`stokes`]).
//!
//! # Connectivity
//!
//! [`ConnectivityRecorder`] adds up the time each particle spends in contact
//! with a set of sites ([`ContactZone`]: net cages, farms). From it,
//! [`ConnectivityMatrix`] gives the share of each site's particles that
//! reach each other site, and [`ConnectivityEnsemble`] gives its spread
//! across random seeds ([`connectivity`]).
//!
//! # Locating particles and boundaries
//!
//! A particle keeps its element and reference coordinates. Each move (the
//! RK stage points and the step itself) walks along the straight segment
//! from the particle's position, face by face ([`walk()`]), so tracking costs
//! O(faces crossed) per move and never searches the whole mesh. At a
//! boundary face the segment is mirrored in the face (walls, specular
//! reflection; no particle crosses a wall) or the particle leaves the
//! domain at the crossing ([`ParticleStatus::Exited`], open boundaries).
//! Periodic faces carry the particle across. With a stranding depth, a
//! particle on water shallower than it is held in place
//! ([`ParticleStatus::Stranded`], a drying tidal flat) until the water
//! there is deep enough again.
