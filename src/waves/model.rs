//! The spectral wave model on the DG mesh: the wave action balance

//!
//! for the action density `N(x, y, σ, θ, t) = E/σ` (Komen et al. 1994; the SWAN
//! Scientific Documentation, §2.2), with
//!
//! - geographic propagation at the group velocity plus the current, discretised
//!   per spectral component by the strong-form DG of the rest of the crate
//!   (Hesthaven & Warburton 2008, §6): the volume term through the contravariant
//!   fluxes, an upwind flux on the faces (the neighbour's face nodes in reverse
//!   order), on the same mesh, order and quadrature;
//! - refraction by depth and current shear, `c_θ = −(1/k)(∂σ/∂d ∂d/∂m + k·∂U/∂m)`,
//!   `m` across the crest (θ + 90°): waves turn towards shallower water;
//! - frequency shifting by currents, `c_σ = ∂σ/∂d U·∇d − c_g k·∂U/∂s` (`s` along
//!   θ; the term of a changing depth `∂σ/∂d ∂d/∂t` is not included yet);
//! - both by finite volumes over the direction bins (periodic) and the frequency
//!   bins (energy leaves through the ends, none comes in): MUSCL, the upwind bin
//!   reconstructed linearly with van Leer's limiter (van Leer 1979; second order
//!   where the spectrum is smooth, TVD), or first-order upwind
//!   ([`SpectralAdvection`]). Every term is in flux form, so the total action
//!   `Σ Δσ Δθ ∫ N dA` is conserved up to what crosses the open boundaries and the
//!   spectral ends.
//!
//! Depth (`d = η − B`, floored at a minimum depth), its gradient, the current and
//! its gradient are nodal fields (gradients by the element's own derivative
//! matrices), set from a circulation run with [`WaveModel2D::set_water_level`] and
//! [`WaveModel2D::set_currents`]; the wavenumber, group velocity and `∂σ/∂d` of
//! every frequency at every node are kept with them.
//!
//! Boundaries: open faces let waves out and bring in the boundary spectrum,
//! one for the whole boundary ([`WaveModel2D::with_boundary_spectrum`]) or one
//! per node of the open faces, changed as often as wanted
//! ([`WaveModel2D::set_boundary_spectra`], e.g. a parent wave model's through
//! [`super::BoundarySpectra`]); every other face absorbs (nothing comes in),
//! as SWAN's default coast.
//!
//! A step ([`WaveModel2D::step`]) is SSP-RK3 for the propagation, with a
//! positivity-preserving scaling of each component in each element towards its
//! mean after every stage (Zhang & Shu 2010; conservative), then the sources over
//! the whole step at every node ([`super::SourceTerms::integrate`]), split
//! first-order in time from the propagation.
//!
//! The propagation's own time error is small next to the sources' (measured on
//! a young wind sea: 8e-5 of H_s after an hour at the geographic step, against
//! 1e-2 with SWAN's sources). [`WaveModel2D::with_substeps`] runs the sources
//! once per several propagation steps, between their halves; the implicit
//! refraction and shifting and depth-induced breaking, which are fast on steep
//! coasts and in the surf zone, stay with each propagation step. With SWAN's
//! frozen rates and per-step limiter
//! that costs accuracy, and frozen rates without the limiter blow up at long
//! steps; WAM's integration ([`super::SourceIntegration::Implicit`] with
//! [`super::GrowthLimiter::Rate`]) keeps the growth curves at an outer step of
//! minutes.
//!
//! On steep slopes refraction turns the waves fast, and its explicit Courant
//! limit `|c_θ| Δt ≤ Δθ` sets a step far below the geographic one (100× at
//! Frøya). [`WaveModel2D::with_implicit_refraction`] takes the direction
//! advection out of the Runge–Kutta stages and steps it implicitly at every
//! node and frequency after them, as SWAN does: first-order upwind in θ,
//! backward Euler, a cyclic tridiagonal system per node and frequency. Its
//! matrix is an M-matrix whose columns sum to one, so the step is positive
//! and conserves the action to round-off at any Courant number. With
//! [`SpectralAdvection::VanLeer`] (the default) a deferred correction adds
//! MUSCL's flux less upwind's, of the state before the step, to the
//! right-hand side: the fixed point is MUSCL's steady state (second order in
//! the bins), and the correction is scaled down where it would make the
//! right-hand side negative (it sums to zero over the circle, so the action is
//! still kept). With [`SpectralAdvection::Upwind`] the steady state is the
//! explicit upwind scheme's (first order).
//!
//! Frequency shifting has the same trouble where currents cross steep, shallow
//! beds: `∂σ/∂d U·∇d` grows as the depth shrinks, and on a tidal flat it set
//! a step of 0.6 s against the geographic 7 s at Frøya.
//! [`WaveModel2D::with_implicit_frequency_shift`] steps it the same way, per
//! node and direction over the frequencies: first-order upwind, backward
//! Euler, a tridiagonal M-matrix (not periodic: action leaves through the
//! ends of the grid, none comes in), whose columns weighted by `Δσ` sum to
//! one but for the ends' outflow; and the same donor-limited MUSCL deferred
//! correction on the faces between the bins.
