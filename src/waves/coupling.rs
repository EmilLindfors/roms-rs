//! The waves and the circulation on meshes of their own (TODO F.4 cost).
//!
//! The spectral waves are smooth on the scale of a kilometre and costly per
//! node (hundreds of components), while the circulation needs the coastline
//! at tens of metres. At Frøya a 1 km P1 wave grid costs ≈ 3× the tidal
//! circulation per model hour, the coastline mesh at P2 ≈ 1000×. So the waves
//! run on a coarse mesh of their own and [`WaveCoupling2D`] carries the
//! exchanges across, by interpolation of the nodal fields
//! ([`MeshTransfer2D`]: each target node evaluates the source element's
//! polynomial there):
//!
//! - circulation → waves ([`WaveCoupling2D::update_waves`]): the surface
//!   elevation η and the depth-averaged current. The current is the ratio of
//!   the interpolated transport and depth, `(hu, hv)/h`, as a station samples
//!   it ([`crate::solver::Probe2D`]): a nearly dry node's `hu/h` does not
//!   count as much as a deep one's. On dry nodes η is the bed, which would
//!   pull a wave node at the shore up to the land; there η is the mean of
//!   the element's wet nodes, or 0 (still water) in a dry element. Wave
//!   nodes outside the circulation's mesh (water the circulation does not
//!   model) take the level at the nearest point of it, and no current.
//! - waves → circulation: the radiation stress `S/ρg`, interpolated and then
//!   differentiated on the circulation's mesh ([`WaveCoupling2D::force`]):
//!   the force `−g ∇·(S/ρg)` keeps its flux form there (its total is the
//!   boundary integral of `S` on the circulation's mesh), which a force
//!   interpolated from the coarse mesh would not, and it is exact for the
//!   interpolated stress. The waves' bed stress and surface roughness, and the
//!   Stokes drift ([`StokesDriftField::transferred`]), are interpolated as
//!   they are, the first two kept non-negative.
//!
//! On the same mesh and order every transfer is the identity (to round-off),
//! so the coupling reproduces the same-mesh one.
//!
//! [`CoupledWaves2D`] runs the waves alongside a running circulation
//! ([`crate::simulation::Simulation::run_with_exchange`]), exchanging every
//! coupling interval `[t, t + Δ]`, as COAWST's couplers do but in turn:
//!
//! 1. the waves take the circulation's level and current at `t`;
//! 2. the waves step to `t + Δ` (their own step, landing on `t + Δ`);
//! 3. the circulation steps to `t + Δ` under the force linear in time from
//!    the waves' at `t` to theirs at `t + Δ` ([`WaveForce2D::between`]), so
//!    the force is continuous in time and an exchange does not ring the
//!    basin, and on its bed friction enhanced by the mean of the waves' bed
//!    stress at the two ends ([`crate::source::WaveCurrentFriction2D`]).
//!
//! The waves see the circulation lagged by up to Δ (the level and current
//! change over a tide, Δ is minutes); the circulation sees the waves without
//! a lag.
