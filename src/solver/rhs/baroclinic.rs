//! Baroclinic pressure gradient in σ-coordinates, from pairwise pressure
//! differences.
//!
//! # The σ-coordinate problem
//!
//! The horizontal pressure gradient force is `F = −(1/ρ₀) ∇p|_z`. On a
//! σ-surface the chain rule gives two large terms that must cancel,
//! `∇p|_z = ∇p|_σ + gρ ∇z|_σ`, and over steep bathymetry any inconsistency in
//! their discretisations appears as a spurious force as large as the physical
//! one (Haney 1991; Mellor et al. 1994). An early discretisation — the
//! element-local derivative of `p` along σ plus `gρ∇z`, with a first-order
//! half-layer pressure — made ~1e-4 m/s² in a stratified fjord at rest.
//!
//! # Pairwise pressure differences
//!
//! Every term of the DG derivative is a pressure difference of a pair of
//! columns. With `D` the element's nodal differentiation matrix
//! (`(Dx)_ij = r_x,i (D_r)_ij + s_x,i (D_s)_ij`, the metric at node `i`),
//!
//! ```text
//!     (∂p/∂x|_z)_i ≈ Σ_j Dx_ij Δp_ij,
//! ```
//!
//! with `Δp_ij` antisymmetric, in one of two forms ([`PressureGradientForm`]).
//! `p_c(z)` is the hydrostatic pressure of column `c` at depth `z`, and `z_i`,
//! `z_j` are the depths of nodes `i`, `j` on the σ-level.
//!
//! **Constant depth** (Stelling & van Kester 1994, in a DG form):
//!
//! ```text
//!     Δp_ij = ½ [ (p_j(z_i) − p_i(z_i)) + (p_j(z_j) − p_i(z_j)) ].
//! ```
//!
//! A smooth function of the node positions, so the sum is a high-order,
//! consistent approximation of `∂p/∂x|_z` (`Σ_j Dx_ij (x_j − x_i) = 1`).
//! Where a node lies below the other column's bed (a hydrostatically
//! inconsistent pair, the discrete Haney condition), only the difference at
//! the shallower node's depth, which both columns reach, is used; first order
//! there, but balanced. In a fluid at rest with `ρ = ρ(z)` every column
//! samples the same profile, so `Δp_ij` is the difference of two
//! interpolants of one profile: zero when `ρ` is linear in `z` (constant
//! `N²`), and the interpolation error otherwise — not amplified by the slope
//! as in the σ form.
//!
//! **σ-pairs** (the σ form `∇_σp + gρ∇_σz` in flux-differencing form):
//!
//! ```text
//!     Δp_ij = (p_j(z_j) − p_i(z_i)) + ½(ρ_i + ρ_j)(z_j − z_i),
//! ```
//!
//! whose second term is `½[ρ∇z + ∇(ρz) − z∇ρ]` at the nodes, the split form
//! of `ρ∇_σz`. Exact for linear `ρ(z)` as well (the trapezoid rule of the
//! pressure along the pair); for a curved profile its error is that rule's,
//! `ρ″Δz³/12` with `Δz` the depth difference of the pair, the σ form's
//! hydrostatic inconsistency (Haney 1991; Mellor et al. 1994): a pycnocline
//! sampled by levels far apart in neighbouring columns makes a large force.
//!
//! # Energy: why σ-pairs are the default
//!
//! In the continuum the work of the pressure gradient on the flow is the
//! conversion to potential energy by the density advection, which is what
//! keeps a stratified fluid at rest stable. Discretely that needs the PGF's
//! `ρ∇z` term to be the negative adjoint of the advection of the background
//! stratification along the sloping σ-levels. Under the GLL nodes'
//! summation by parts `MD + DᵀM = B`, the σ-pairs' term is exactly that for
//! the split-form advection of
//! [`crate::solver::rhs::advective_divergence_element`]: with `ρ̄ = a + bz`,
//! the advection makes `−b·½[∇·(Qz) + Q·∇z − z∇·Q]` of the background, and
//! summed against the nodes it pairs with `½[ρ′∇z + ∇(ρ′z) − z∇ρ′]` up to
//! face terms. In terms of the total potential energy `Σ gρz H_z` the
//! horizontal exchange is exact for any `ρ`, not only about a linear
//! background: both terms are sums of `(MD)_ij {{Q}}_ij {{ρ}}_ij (z_j − z_i)`
//! with opposite signs. (The vertical half, the Hermite pressure integral
//! against the vertical advection's face values, matches only for linear
//! profiles.) The constant-depth form has no such partner: its vertical
//! interpolation of the neighbour's pressure is not the transpose of
//! anything the advection does.
//!
//! Measured over a stratified seamount at rest (`examples/seamount_3d.rs`:
//! constant `N²`, 16 × 16 P2 elements of 4 km, 20 stretched levels, bed
//! 40–400 m, `r_x0` 0.32), the growth of the round-off velocity every 6 h:
//!
//! | PGF | horizontal advection | growth per 6 h |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | constant depth | conservative `∇·(Qφ)` | × 11 (× 18 on 2 km elements) |
//! | constant depth | split form | × 5 |
//! | σ-pairs | conservative | × 3.5 |
//! | σ-pairs | split form | none (7e-11 m/s after 2 days) |
//!
//! Neither horizontal viscosity (10 m²/s), vertical viscosity (1e-2 m²/s),
//! a penalty on the layer velocities' face jumps, nor a gentler slope
//! (`r_x0` 0.08: blew up after 3 days) stopped the growth of the first row.
//!
//! Exact energy exchange is not enough on its own. Rest is stable when a
//! conserved functional has its minimum there. The split form also conserves
//! the tracer variance `Σ H_z ρ²`, and for a linear `ρ(z)` energy plus
//! `g/(2|∂_z ρ|)` times the variance is such a functional. For a curved
//! profile there is none once a σ-level crosses the pycnocline between two
//! nodes of one element, as at the cliffs of a fjord coast. There the pair's
//! chord `Δρ/Δz` is far steeper than the stratification at either node, and
//! round-off grows (e-folding ≈ 15 min on the Frøya bed, ≈ 45 min in the
//! x–z cliff of `a_pycnocline_over_a_cliff_stays_at_rest`; TODO P1.3).
//!
//! # Balanced reference
//!
//! The price of σ-pairs is the σ form's error at rest. A stored reference
//! state `ρ_s` (the initial stratification, or a parent model's) takes it
//! back ([`BalancedReference`]):
//!
//! ```text
//!     F(ρ) = F_σ(ρ) + [F_z(ρ_s) − F_σ(ρ_s)],
//! ```
//!
//! with `F_σ`, `F_z` the σ-pair and constant-depth forces. The bracket is a
//! fixed field, so the dynamics (and their stability) are σ-pairs', while a
//! fluid resting in the reference state feels the constant-depth form's
//! force; for a horizontally uniform `ρ_s(z)` this is the subtraction of a
//! reference profile of Mellor et al. (1998), here for any reference field.
//!
//! # Curvilinear elements
//!
//! On a general quadrilateral the metric varies over the element, and which
//! metric a pair is differenced with decides the energy argument above. The
//! work of the force on the layer transport `Q` is
//! `Σ_ij w_i D_ij Q_i·X_ij S_ij` for the pair's metric `X_ij` and an
//! antisymmetric `S_ij`, and under summation by parts (the boundary matrix is
//! diagonal and `S_ii = 0`) an advection whose pair transport is
//! `A_ij·Q_i + B_ij·Q_j` matches it when `X_ij = A_ij + B_ji`. The 3D
//! advection must reduce, for a constant field, to the layer continuity, the
//! 2D module's mass divergence ([`MetricForm`]), and must be a symmetric
//! two-point flux to conserve. So the force takes:
//!
//! - [`MetricForm::Conservative`] (`Standard` 2D module): each node's own
//!   metric, `(Dx)_ij = J_i⁻¹[(J∇r)_i (D_r)_ij + (J∇s)_i (D_s)_ij]·x̂`, the
//!   chain rule, the adjoint of the advection's `{{J∇r·Q}}_ij`;
//! - [`MetricForm::Averaged`] (the split forms): the pair's mean,
//!   `J_i⁻¹[{{J∇r}}_ij (D_r)_ij + {{J∇s}}_ij (D_s)_ij]·x̂`, the adjoint of
//!   `{{J∇r}}_ij·{{Q}}_ij`.
//!
//! On a parallelogram both are the affine derivative. Both are consistent
//! (the averaged one is `½[J∇r·D_r p + D_r(J∇r p)]/J` by the discrete metric
//! identities) and move momentum only across faces over level σ-surfaces, and
//! the balances at rest (`Δp_ij = 0`) do not depend on the element shape.
//! What differs is the aliasing of the metric times the pressure: on meshes
//! that are not asymptotically parallelograms (each element's bilinear term
//! a fixed fraction of its size, as on a coastline mesh) the averaged form
//! is one order lower pointwise (P2 1.1, P3 2.1 against the chain rule's 1.9
//! and 2.8, `tests/curvilinear_3d_test.rs`), while its element means are the
//! chain rule's and converge at about `N + 1`: the extra error is grid-scale,
//! with zero mean on every element. On the faces the normal, `sJ` and `J`
//! are those of each face node, as in the 3D transport.
//!
//! # Common to both forms
//!
//! Each column's density anomaly `ρ − ρ_ref` is a piecewise Hermite cubic in
//! `z` through the level values, with monotone harmonic-mean slopes
//! (Shchepetkin & McWilliams 2003, §5), continued linearly above the top and
//! below the bottom level. `p_c(z)` integrates it exactly from the surface.
//! A horizontally uniform `ρ(x)` over a flat bed is exact in both forms.
//!
//! **Faces.** The element-local sum ignores the neighbours. The jump of the
//! pressure across each face, in the same form, is lifted with a central
//! flux (`p* − p⁻ = ½Δp`), so a density front (or an `η` jump, for the full
//! PGF) sitting on a face exerts its force. In a fluid at rest the jump is
//! zero.
//!
//! **Reference density.** The integrated density is `ρ − rho_ref`:
//! `rho_ref = 0` gives the full PGF, whose `ρ`-uniform part is `−g∇η`
//! (DG-coupled through the face lift); `rho_ref = ρ₀` gives the
//! baroclinic-only PGF of mode splitting, where `−g∇η` comes from the 2D
//! module.
