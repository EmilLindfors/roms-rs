# NorKyst-800 v3: tides, datum, pressure and velocities, for MET Norway (P3.1, P1.5)

Measured 2026-10-16 against 17 Kartverket gauges from Tregde to Vardø, on NorKyst-800 v3 as published on MET's THREDDS: the operational "best estimate" aggregation `fou-hi/norkystv3_800m_m00_be` (2024-01 to now), the hindcast `romshindcast/norkyst_v3/norkyst_v3_sdepth_aggr.ncml` (2012-01 to 2025-08), and the two tidal forcing files MET publishes. Everything below comes out of one script, `./scripts/norkyst_tide_check.sh` (see "Reproducing"); the full tables it writes are `output/norkyst_issues/tables.md` and `output/norkyst_issues/forcing.md`.

## Summary

1. **Our analysis is not the problem.** A record built from UTide's astronomy (none of ours) is recovered by our 30-day fit to ≤ 5 % per constituent, N2 to 1 % (`tests/harmonic_analysis_test.rs`); under 0.10 m of red weather noise a 30-day N2 is 0.999 ± 0.016 of the truth. On the real series UTide gives the same NorKyst/gauge N2 as our fit (within 0.01–0.04). The gauges' June N2 is their year's within 0–3 %, and Kartverket's own prediction has 0.99–1.00 of the observed N2. NorKyst's ζ is instantaneous (`cell_methods: point`) on whole UTC hours, and its M2 phase agrees with the gauges within ±1.1° (2 min) at 11 of 17 gauges.
2. **NorKyst's N2 was 0.10–0.24 of the observed at every gauge** (median 0.19, phase −6° at Stavanger to −56° at Tromsø) **from January 2024 to February 2026, and is right since March 2026** (0.85–1.18, median 0.99, ±6°). The cause is in MET's tide file: the one that forces the hindcast (`forcing/tide.nc`, created 2023-03-31) has N2/M2 of 0.020–0.034 along the open boundaries against the gauges' 0.21; the one created 2026-02-25 (`static_nc_files/norkyst_tide.nc`) has 0.20–0.26. The 2012–2025 hindcast has N2 at 0.30–0.44 (median 0.38).
3. **Still wrong in the operational output in 2026:** K2 is 0.81 of the observed (0.78 in 2024–25), and K2/S2 relative to the gauges is 0.80 (0.78), as if K2's nodal factor (f ≈ 1.3 in 2024–26) were not applied; P1 is 1.7× and Q1 1.7× (1.35× in 2024–25), not explained by the forcing file's amplitudes; the minor semidiurnals (2N2, μ2, ν2, L2, λ2) are absent (mostly 0.01–0.13×; 2–7 cm of |ΔZ| together); M4 is 0.23×. The hindcast over 2024–25 differs from the forecasts on the same dates (K2 0.72×, N2 0.38×), and neither matches correct nodal factors; a static tide file used without them is wrong by an amount that changes through the 18.6-year nodal cycle.
4. **Datum.** NorKyst's mean ζ is 0.28 m below the gauges' mean (median; 0.20–0.40 m, deepest in Finnmark), so 0.22–0.52 m below NN2000 too; it is neither MSL nor NN2000.
5. **Pressure.** NorKyst's non-tidal ζ responds to sea-level pressure at a quarter of the gauges' rate (−0.22 against −0.80 cm/hPa, daily means against ERA5); the gauge-minus-NorKyst residual regresses on pressure at −0.58 cm/hPa (r = −0.8). So NorKyst's ζ carries little of the inverse barometer, although its configuration has `ATM_PRESS`.
6. **Velocities.** The operational output has no ubar/vbar (the hindcast has `ubar_eastward`/`vbar_northward`), and its z-levels stop at 300 m.

Correction to the brief: Mausund's K1 1.14× and O1 0.95× came from a year fit of the gauge against a 30-day fit of NorKyst; on the same 30 days (June 2025) they are K1 1.21×, O1 1.10× (the year fit, both sides: K1 1.06×, O1 0.95×). A 30-day record cannot separate P1 from K1 or K2 from S2 (182.6 days), so the diurnal and K2/S2 numbers below come from the year (2024-07 to 2025-07) and the 2026-04 to 2026-10 half year.

| Step | Script | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Gauges: Kartverket observations and predictions, 17 permanent gauges | `scripts/kartverket_gauge.sh`, list in `scripts/norkyst_tide_gauges.csv` | `data/tide_gauges/coast/<CODE>_{obs,pre}[_2026-04].txt`, `<CODE>_obs_<year>.txt` (BGO, MSU, BOO, 2024–26) |
| NorKyst ζ at the nearest wet cell to each gauge (92–1866 m away), hourly | `scripts/norkyst_gauge_series.py` (`url=` for the hindcast) | `data/norkyst_gauges/{2024-07_2025-07,2026-04_2026-10,2024-01_2026-10,hindcast_2024-07_2025-07}/<CODE>.txt` |
| Our fit of gauge and NorKyst on the instants both have, one analysis | `examples/tide_gauge_fit.rs <gauge> compare=<NorKyst> csv=` | `output/norkyst_issues/fits.csv` (and `fits_pre.csv`, gauge against Kartverket's prediction) |
| Tables, the pair test, UTide, datum, pressure, plots | `scripts/norkyst_tide_report.py` | `tables.md`, `ratios_latitude.png`, `phases_latitude.png`, `n2_monthly.png` |
| The forcing files themselves | `scripts/norkyst_tide_forcing.py` | `forcing.md` |
| The analysis gates | `cargo test --test harmonic_analysis_test` | `test_n2_q1_recovery_against_independent_astronomy`, `test_thirty_day_n2_q1_under_weather_noise` |

Every comparison uses the instants both series have (NorKyst's aggregation has five 25–27 h gaps in 2024, which are left out, never filled). Ratios are NorKyst over the gauge; ΔG = G_NorKyst − G_gauge (> 0: NorKyst later). Pressure is ERA5 `pressure_msl` from the Open-Meteo archive (cached in `data/pressure/`); MSL and NN2000 come from Kartverket's `locationlevels` (cached in `data/kartverket/`).

## 1. Is it our analysis? (no)

- **Independent astronomy.** `test_n2_q1_recovery_against_independent_astronomy` builds 2025-06-01 + 30 days hourly from the standard speeds and UTide's f, V₀ + u (`uv run scripts/norkyst_tide_report.py fuv 2025-06-01 2025-07-01` prints them) with Mausund-sized constants; the fit `tide_gauge_fit` runs recovers every constituent to ≤ 5 % of its amplitude (Q1's 4.4 % is the two astronomies' satellite terms: f 2.6 %, u 2° apart) and N2 to 1 %.
- **Weather noise.** `test_thirty_day_n2_q1_under_weather_noise`: 40 realizations of 0.10 m AR(1) noise (the gauges' 30-day residual is 0.075 m in June, 0.11–0.16 m in January) give N2 0.999 ± 0.016 (worst 6 %), Q1 1.01 ± 0.21 (worst 56 %). A single 30-day Q1 ratio is noise; N2 is not.
- **The gauges' own N2** (`tables.md` A1): June/year 1.00–1.03 at 16 gauges (Stavanger 0.94, N2 there 0.03 m); Kartverket's prediction over the year has 0.986–1.001 of our observed N2. N2/M2 at the gauges is 0.18–0.25 (0.207 median), normal.
  - January/year is 0.75–0.82 at 16 gauges (Tregde 1.07): over 30 days ν2 (≈ 0.18 of N2 here, 206 days from N2) cannot be separated and beats against N2. NorKyst has no ν2, so its monthly N2 ratio against the gauge swings ±20 % for this reason alone (Jan 2025 0.25, June 2025 0.17 at the median gauge; `n2_monthly.png`). Use the long windows.
- **UTide against our fit on the real series** (A2, June 2025): N2 ratio 0.075–0.239 ours against 0.111–0.238 UTide (UTide fits more constituents; Mausund 0.175 / 0.188, Bodø 0.188 / 0.193).
- **Time axis** (A3): every NorKyst sample is on a whole UTC hour; M2 ΔG over the year is within ±1.1° at 11 gauges, −1.7 to −6.6° at Tregde, Stavanger, Bergen, Måløy, Heimsjø, Tromsø (≤ 14 min, local).
- V₀, f, u are applied identically to both series by construction: `tide_gauge_fit compare=` restricts both to the shared instants and fits them with the same `HarmonicAnalysis`.

## 2. N2, coast-wide, and fixed in March 2026

Our fit, NorKyst against the gauge, ratio (ΔG °). The plots are `output/norkyst_issues/ratios_latitude.png` and `phases_latitude.png`; June 2025, January 2025 and June 2026 (30 days each) are in `tables.md` B.

Median ratio: N2 0.99, Q1 1.73, O1 1.00, K1 1.06, S2 1.00, M2 1.01, M4 0.23, K2 0.81, P1 1.72. RSS median 0.057 m: the new file removed about 60 % of NorKyst's tidal error at the gauges.

- **Coast-wide, not local:** the N2 deficit is the same at all 17 gauges from Tregde to Vardø and in both seasons (June 2025 median 0.17, January 2025 0.25, the year 0.19); the gauges' N2/M2 is normal everywhere. Tregde (an M2 amphidrome, M2 0.08 m) and Stavanger are the noisy ends of every table.
- **When it changed** (`tables.md` E, `n2_monthly.png`, calendar months at Bergen, Mausund and Bodø, 2024-01 to 2026-09): N2 0.07–0.25 in every month through 2026-02, 0.80–1.18 from 2026-03 (the ±20 % is the ν2 beat of section 1). The tide file is dated 2026-02-25; February is still wrong at all three gauges, so the switch came between 2026-02-25 and early March.
- **The hindcast** (`tables.md` B.hindcast, 2024-07..2025-07, the same instants): N2 0.30–0.44 (median 0.38, −4 to −28°), K2 0.72 (−14°), P1 1.73, Q1 1.28, M2 1.03, RSS median 0.126 m: better N2 than the forecasts of the same dates (0.19), worse K2 (0.78), so the two were not forced alike.

## 3. What the forcing files contain (`output/norkyst_issues/forcing.md`)

Both files: `title = Tidal forcing from met.no`, `history = Created by tide2roms from sequential files from met.no`, `constituents = K2 S2 M2 N2 K1 P1 O1 Q1`, periods correct and in that order (11.967235 … 26.868357 h): no period/order mix-up. Values on the whole grid (the atlas interpolated), of which ROMS uses the open boundaries.

- The new file has 9.05× the old one's N2 on the boundaries and the other amplitudes within 0–9 %; its phases are the old ones shifted uniformly per constituent (M2 +84.4°, O1 +68.4°, K2 +19.8°, S2 −0.2°), i.e. a different reference date; N2's shift scatters (+23 to +79°), the old N2 phases being wrong too.
- **The reference date.** ROMS forces ζ = A cos(ω(t − TIDE_START) − φ), so G − φ = V₀(T₀) + u(T₀) at every gauge. Searched hourly over 2010–2027 against the gauges' G: the new file fits **2017-01-01 00:00 UTC with V₀ + u** (weighted RMS 4.5° over the eight constituents; the next minimum more than 30 days away 6.3°), which is `TIDE_START` in the published configuration (Zenodo 10.5281/zenodo.16810677, `roms_norkyst.in`: `TIDE_START = 17167.0d0`, `TIME_REF = 19700101`). Its amplitudes carry 2017's nodal factors: file/gauge K2 0.752 against f(2017) = 0.764, O1 0.851 against 0.825. The old file fits 2014-01-01 00:00 (6.2°, but N2 alone is off by 57°).
- **So the static file is a 2017 snapshot.** Used as is from 2017-01-01, it gives the tide of 2017's nodal state at every later date: in 2025–26 K2 at 0.58–0.60 of the truth, O1 0.70, K1 0.80, M2 1.07 (f(2017)/f(2025); `tables.md` C, "frozen at 2017-01-01"). Neither output behaves like that: the forecasts have K2 0.78–0.81× and M2 1.01–1.02×, the hindcast K2 0.72× and M2 1.03× (K2/S2 0.72, against 0.58 for a file frozen at 2017 and 0.76 without nodal factors), so the runs apparently re-reference the files in a way the published configuration does not show.
- No tidal potential in the interior: the configuration (`norkyst.h`) defines `SSH_TIDES`, `UV_TIDES`, `ADD_FSOBC`, `ADD_M2OBC`, not `TIDE_GENERATING_FORCES`. The NorKyst v3 paper (Christensen et al. 2026, GMD 19, 2785, doi:10.5194/gmd-19-2785-2026) names TPXO9 as the source, without the constituent list or nodal handling. NorKyst v2 (Albretsen et al. 2011, Fisken og Havet 2/2011) used TPXO7.2's eight constituents with per-run phase shifts and nodal corrections (`tidenc2roms`).

## 4. What is still wrong in 2026: the frequency-pair test

A pair of constituents close in frequency sees the same shelf dynamics (resonance, friction, resolution), so (X/Y)_NorKyst / (X/Y)_gauge isolates the forcing. Our fit, median over 17 gauges (`tables.md` C):

| pair (Δfrequency) | 2024-07..2025-07 | 2026-04..2026-10 | no nodal factors (2025 / 2026) | nodal frozen at 2017-01-01 (2025 / 2026) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N2/M2 (3.6 %) | 0.175, −31° | 0.975, +0° | 1.00 / 1.00 | 1.01 / 1.00 |
| K2/S2 (0.27 %) | 0.779, +6° | 0.802, +14° | 0.762 / 0.785 | 0.583 / 0.601 |
| M2/S2 (3.5 %) | 1.036, −2° | 1.002, −1° | 1.040 / 1.035 | 1.078 / 1.074 |
| P1/K1 (0.55 %) | 1.661, +13° | 1.723, +12° | 1.126 / 1.112 | 1.274 / 1.257 |
| Q1/O1 (3.9 %) | 1.137, −21° | 1.508, −14° | 0.984 / 0.959 | 1.012 / 0.986 |

- **K2:** 0.78–0.80 of the gauges relative to S2 in both periods, 13 of 17 gauges between 0.73 and 0.83, matching a K2 forced without its nodal factor (f = 1.31 in 2025, so 0.76) and not the 2017 snapshot (0.58–0.60). In 2024–25 M2/S2 (1.036) matches the same hypothesis (1.040); in 2026 it does not (1.002), so the 2026 change may have altered M2 too (or the response, with the new grid `norkyst_grd_v31.nc`); K2/S2 is the cleaner test. K2's error is 1–2 cm at most gauges. The hindcast's K2/S2 is 0.72 (−16°), between the two hypotheses.
- **P1:** 1.7× K1's ratio in both periods and in the hindcast (P1/K1 relative 1.36–2.11 from Bergen north). P1 and K1 are 0.55 % apart, so this is forcing (or forcing-like, e.g. atmospheric), but the files' P1/K1 is normal (0.26–0.35 on the boundaries, file/gauge 1.03 for P1 and 0.95 for K1 at the gauges). Not explained. Not a stitching artefact of the best-estimate aggregation: the hindcast has the same P1, S1 is small (NorKyst 0.002–0.008 m against the gauges' 0.004–0.011, `tables.md` H), and the residual's step into 00 UTC is at most 1.17× the other hours' at 13 gauges (1.3–2.2× at Træna, Bodø, Kabelvåg and Hammerfest, a small restart jump worth mentioning to MET).
- **Q1:** 1.35× (2024–25) and 1.73× (2026) of the gauges (Q1/O1 relative 1.14 and 1.51, so Q1 got worse in 2026; the file's Q1 changed by ×1.09, −11.6°). The files' Q1/O1 matches the gauges' 0.44 (the equilibrium 0.19 is not the reference here). Not explained either.
- **Minor semidiurnals absent** (UTide, the year, `tables.md` D): 2N2 0.03–0.13×, μ2 0.01–0.13× (Tromsø 0.36), ν2 0.02–0.09× (Stavanger 0.28), L2 0.01–0.13×, λ2 0.02–0.26×, 0.004–0.043 m each at the gauges; root sum of squares 0.020–0.072 m per gauge. Expected with eight constituents; TPXO9 (2N2) and FES2014 (μ2, ν2, L2, 2N2, λ2) have them.
- **Overtides:** M4 0.13–0.55× (median 0.23) in both periods except at Tregde (1.9×, an M2 amphidrome) and Måløy (0.7×); the forcing has no M4, and an 800 m grid on a smoothed bed (2–3× deeper than Kartverket's topobathy in 3–60 m of water, `notes/validation.md`) generates little.

## 5. Datum (`tables.md` F)

| | median | range |
|---|---|---|
| NorKyst − gauge mean, 2024-07..2025-07 | −0.280 m | −0.398 (Vardø) to −0.202 m (Trondheim) |
| June 2025 / January 2025 (30 days) | −0.279 / −0.327 m | |
| 2026-04..2026-10 | −0.238 m | −0.340 to −0.158 m |
| NorKyst mean − NN2000 (year) | −0.307 m | −0.523 to −0.223 m |

The gauges' year mean is +0.04 to +0.11 m above Kartverket's MSL (1996–2014), and NN2000 lies 0.05–0.24 m above that MSL (more in the north), so NorKyst's ζ is referenced to neither; its offset deepens northward and varies by 4–10 cm between seasons and years. The attribute says "Sea surface height above geoid"; MET documents no reference level or mean dynamic topography. A plausible source is the parent's mean SSH (CMEMS/TOPAZ daily means at the Chapman boundary): a question for MET.

## 6. Pressure (`tables.md` G)

Daily means of the non-tidal residual (UTide year fit removed) against ERA5 sea-level pressure at each gauge, 2024-07..2025-07, 361–363 days:

- The gauges: −0.69 to −1.00 cm/hPa (median −0.80; the static inverse barometer is −0.99, the rest is wind and the dynamic response).
- NorKyst: −0.07 (Tregde) to −0.56 cm/hPa (Vardø), median −0.22.
- Gauge − NorKyst: median −0.58 cm/hPa, r −0.48 to −0.82: the pressure explains most of what NorKyst misses (the difference's σ is 9–10 cm).

So NorKyst's ζ carries roughly a quarter of the observed pressure response, least in the south, although the GMD paper says "the atmospheric pressure is also included in the forcing" (`ATM_PRESS`, with `PRESS_COMPENSATE` at the boundaries). Either the published ζ has the inverse barometer removed, or the open boundary holds the level to the parent's (which has no surge; ROMS's `PRESS_COMPENSATE` acts in the Shchepetkin ubar condition, while ζ uses Chapman). For us: `froya_real_data ib=1` adds an inverse barometer that NorKyst mostly lacks, so it does not count it twice (at most ≈ 0.2 of 0.8 cm/hPa).

## 7. Velocities

- The operational aggregation and its daily `_AN` files hold `zeta`, `u_eastward`, `v_northward`, `w`, T, S, `AKs` and wind on 15 z-levels (0–300 m), no `ubar`/`vbar`; we depth-average the z-levels (`io::depth_average_z`), and deeper columns repeat the 300 m value, so boundary transports are approximate.
- The hindcast (`romshindcast/norkyst_v3/norkyst_v3_sdepth_aggr.ncml`, hourly 2012-01-05 to 2025-08-02) has `ubar_eastward`, `vbar_northward` and s-level fields. ROMS writes ubar/vbar in the forecasts too (`Hout(idUbar) == T` in the configuration); only the published product lacks them.

## 8. Minor

- The point/NCSS endpoint answers 503 most of the time; OPeNDAP windows (this report's fetches) work, with occasional DAP failures that succeed on retry.
- The bed and resolution (complaint 4 of the brief) and the overtides (5) are limitations of an 800 m model, not defects; they are documented in `notes/validation.md` and listed here for context only.

## What this means for us

- The boundary atlases built from NorKyst for 2025 dates (`data/froya_boundary_tides.txt`, `data/bodo_boundary_tides.txt`, June 2025) carry the old forcing's N2 (and K2, P1, Q1): `gauge_ratios`/`gauge_gains` stay necessary for them, circular as they are. For dates from 2026-03, NorKyst's N2 is right and the N2 correction is no longer needed; K2 (≈ 0.8×), P1 (1.7×) and Q1 (1.7×) still are, and theory can replace the gauge for two of them without circularity: K2 = 0.272 S2 and P1 = 0.331 K1 at the equilibrium ratios (`Inference::EQUILIBRIUM`; the gauges' own ratios are 0.284 and 0.268).
- P3.4 (Bodø, pre-registered) uses 2025-06 atlases with `nest_tides=raw`: its raw-forcing score includes NorKyst's 2025 N2 defect (0.20× at Bodø). That is part of what "raw" measures, but it is now known to be fixed in later NorKyst.
- `ib=1` is safe with NorKyst nesting (section 6).
- The datum offset varies along the coast (0.20–0.40 m) and by season (4–10 cm), so a per-domain mean of the parent over the run's own window (what `froya_real_data` does) is the right default; a library default could take the gauges' (MSL) or the NN2000 offset per point, but neither matches NorKyst.
- The hindcast's ubar/vbar can measure the error of our z-level depth average (`io::depth_average_z`, 300 m cap) for 2012–2025 dates.

## Draft message to MET (for Emil to send, in Norwegian; to Magne Simonsen <magnes@met.no>, cc fou-hi@met.no)

> **Emne:** NorKyst-800 v3-vannstand mot Kartverkets vannstandsmålere: N2 (rettet i mars 2026?), K2, P1/Q1, lufttrykk og datum
>
> Hei Magne,
>
> Jeg kjører en kystmodell nestet i NorKyst-800 v3 (Frøya/Mausund og Bodø) og validerer den mot Kartverkets vannstandsmålere. Underveis sammenlignet jeg også NorKysts ζ direkte med de 17 permanente målerne fra Tregde til Vardø. Begge seriene er analysert harmonisk på samme måte og på de samme timene, over 2024-07 til 2025-07 (best estimate-aggregeringen fou-hi/norkystv3_800m_m00_be og hindcasten romshindcast/norkyst_v3) og over 2026-04 til 2026-10. Jeg har kontrollert den harmoniske analysen vår mot UTide og mot syntetiske tidsserier, og Kartverkets egne prediksjoner stemmer med analysene våre av målerne, så jeg er rimelig sikker på at dette er NorKysts tall og ikke våre. Tabeller og figurer er vedlagt. Her er kortversjonen, med spørsmålene mine:
>
> 1. **N2, som jeg tror nå er rettet.** Fra januar 2024 til februar 2026 var NorKysts N2 0,10–0,24 av den observerte ved alle målerne (median 0,19), og 6° (Stavanger) til 56° (Tromsø) for tidlig i fase, mens M2 og S2 lå innenfor noen få prosent. Fra mars 2026 stemmer den (median 0,99, innenfor ±6°). Det passer med tidevannsfilene: romshindcast/norkyst_v3/forcing/tide.nc (laget 2023-03-31) har N2/M2 ≈ 0,02–0,03 på de åpne randene, mot 0,21 ved målerne, mens fou-hi/norkystv3_his_files/static_nc_files/norkyst_tide.nc (laget 2026-02-25) har 0,20–0,26.
>    - Kan du bekrefte at varslene har gått over til den nye filen, og fra hvilken dato?
>    - Hindcasten for 2012–2025 har N2 på 0,38 av den observerte (2024–25). Er det planlagt en ny kjøring, eller kan det noteres i metadataene?
>
> 2. **K2 og nodalkorreksjoner.** Relativt til S2 er NorKysts K2 0,78–0,80 av den observerte i begge periodene. De to ligger bare 0,27 % fra hverandre i frekvens, så modellens dynamikk behandler dem likt, og 0,78 er det man får for K2 uten nodalfaktoren (f ≈ 1,3 i 2024–26). Fasene i 2026-filen passer med referansetiden 2017-01-01 00 UTC med f og u for 2017, som er TIDE_START i den publiserte roms_norkyst.in. Men resultatene oppfører seg heller ikke som et tidevann frosset i 2017 (det ville gitt K2 ≈ 0,6), og hindcastens K2 er 0,72. Hvordan oppdateres f og u til kjøringsdatoen, i varslene og i hindcasten?
>
> 3. **P1 og Q1.** P1 er 1,7 ganger den observerte langs hele kysten, i begge periodene og i hindcasten. Q1 er 1,35 ganger (2024–25) og 1,7 ganger (2026). K1 og O1 ligger nær (medianer 1,06 og 1,00). P1 og K1 er bare 0,55 % fra hverandre i frekvens, så dette ser ut til å komme fra pådrivet, men P1 og Q1 i filene ser normale ut for meg. Har du en idé om hvor det kommer fra? (En mindre ting: ved Træna, Bodø, Kabelvåg og Hammerfest hopper best estimate-serien litt mer ved 00 UTC enn ved andre timer, antagelig der de daglige kjøringene skjøtes.)
>
> 4. **Lufttrykk.** Den ikke-tidevannsdrevne delen av NorKysts ζ responderer på lufttrykket ved havnivå med omtrent en firedel av målernes rate: −0,22 mot −0,80 cm/hPa, fra døgnmidler mot ERA5. Differansen måler minus NorKyst regresserer på trykket med −0,58 cm/hPa (r ≈ −0,8). GMD-artikkelen sier at lufttrykket er med i pådrivet. Er den publiserte ζ korrigert for invers barometereffekt, eller holder den åpne randen nivået til morsmodellens? Jeg må vite om jeg skal legge til invers barometer selv.
>
> 5. **Datum.** NorKysts midlere ζ ligger 0,28 m under målernes middel (median; 0,20 m i Trondheim til 0,40 m i Vardø) og 0,31 m under NN2000, så den er referert til ingen av dem. Hva er den referert til? Morsmodellens midlere dynamiske topografi? En linje om det i metadataene ville hjelpe alle som sammenligner med vannstandsmålere.
>
> 6. **Mindre tidevannskomponenter.** 2N2, μ2, ν2 og L2 mangler, til sammen omtrent 2–7 cm ved målerne. Ville det være mulig å legge dem til (fra TPXO9 eller FES2014)?
>
> 7. **ubar/vbar.** Kunne de operative resultatene fått med ubar/vbar, slik hindcasten har? Nå dybdemidler jeg de 15 z-nivåene, som stopper på 300 m, så transportene på randen blir omtrentlige.
>
> Alt kommer ut av ett skript (Kartverkets API, THREDDS-serveren deres og ERA5-trykk). Jeg deler det gjerne, og kjører gjerne på nytt det du vil se. Takk for NorKyst, og for at den er åpent tilgjengelig.

## Caveats and dead ends

- 30-day Q1 and the K2/P1 separation are noise- or Rayleigh-limited (section 1); the coast-wide claims use the year and the half year.
- The research note that the files' Q1/O1 (0.35–0.63) is "2–3× too large" compared it with the equilibrium 0.19; the gauges here have 0.44, so the files' Q1 is normal.
- The best-estimate aggregation's daily stitching at 00 UTC leaves a small step at four northern gauges and none elsewhere (section 4); with the hindcast's identical P1 it does not explain P1/Q1.
- Nearest-wet-cell sampling puts some NorKyst points 1–1.9 km from the gauge (Kristiansund, Rørvik, Bodø, Ålesund); the pair test cancels that, and N2 is low at the close points too (Tromsø 92 m, Stavanger 129 m).
