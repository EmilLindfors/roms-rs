# Notes

Context behind `TODO.md`, one file per area: the findings, measurements, decisions, dead ends and finished work that the one-line items in `TODO.md` point to. Read the file for the area you are working in; you rarely need more than one or two.

The files were split out of the old 1,500-line `TODO.md` on 2026-10-10, verbatim, so the item IDs (P1.3, F.4, …) still match the CHANGELOG, the code's doc comments and git history. Notes are point-in-time: each entry is dated, and the code wins where they disagree.

Reference documents live in `docs/`: `architecture.md` (module tree, status by layer), `accuracy.md` (verified convergence and conservation), `gmsh-meshes.md`, `stratified-rest-over-steep-beds.md`, `windows-native-deps.md`.

## Conventions

- **`TODO.md` holds open items only**, one line each, starting with the item's ID (`**P1.3**`) under a section whose heading links its notes file. Search the notes file for the ID to find the context. No results, no history.
- **Finishing an item:** delete its line from `TODO.md`, and record the outcome (date, PR, the numbers) under the item's heading in its notes file. Notable changes also go in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **A new opportunity or follow-up:** a one-line checkbox in `TODO.md` under the matching area; put the measurement, file/function pointer and reasoning in the notes file when it takes more than the line.
- **A new area:** add a file here and a row to the table above.
