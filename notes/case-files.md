# Generic cases and case files (P8)

## Goal (2026-11-07)

A modeller from the ROMS community, or anyone with a coastline, a bed and some forcing, should be able to run their own coastal domain without writing Rust: one case file, one binary. Until now each domain has been an example with its constants hard-wired. The real application, `examples/froya_real_data.rs`, is 6,655 lines: 77 `key=value` options plus Frøya constants (`FROYA_BBOX`, `DEM`, `F_CORIOLIS = 1.31e-4`, `MANNING_N`, the gauge constituent lists). The library pieces are already generic: `Mesh2D` and the Gmsh reader, `BedRaster`, `coriolis_parameter(lat)`, `CharacteristicOBC` with its providers, `OceanModelReader`, `AtmosphereReader` and `NetCDFWriter`. What is missing is the layer that assembles them from a description.

The aquaculture work continues on top of this. Frøya and Bodø become case files, and the farm, waves and particles become optional sections.

## Decisions proposed

- **Format: TOML.**
  - It allows comments, it is what Rust tooling uses (Cargo), and it is the closest of the three to ROMS's `ocean.in` (`KEY = value`, with sections).
  - The schema is plain `serde` structs, so JSON comes almost for free for scripts that generate cases, from the file extension.
  - No YAML: `serde_yaml` is unmaintained, and indentation errors are a poor first experience.
  - New dependencies: `serde`, `toml` (and `serde_json` for JSON), behind a default `case` feature.
- **Strict schema.**
  - `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` everywhere, so a misspelt key is an error. This replaces `Arguments::refuse_unread` (P6) for cases.
  - Units in key names (`duration_hours`, `band_km`).
  - Each default lives in one place, the schema, and the docs list it.
- **Effective configuration.** The binary resolves defaults, writes the complete case next to the output (`case.resolved.toml`) and into each restart, and compares that on resume. This closes P5.3's gap: a changed default or an omitted option is no longer missed.
- **Binary:** `src/bin/` subcommands:
  - `run case.toml`
  - `check case.toml`: validate and print the resolved case
  - `mesh case.toml`: build the mesh and write it to Gmsh/VTK to inspect
  - Overrides as `--set physics.manning = 0.03` for sweeps.

  The binary is `dgcom` (`dgcom run case.toml`), after the crate (renamed 2026-11-07, PR #192).
- **One path.** Each part of `froya_real_data` that moves into the case layer is deleted from the example (CLAUDE.md: no duplicate paths). The example ends as a thin wrapper or disappears.

## Schema sketch

```toml
[run]
start = "2025-06-15T00:00:00Z"    # ModelClock epoch
duration_hours = 24
ramp_hours = 1

[domain]
# One of: a Gmsh file, or a rectangle over a bbox clipped to water by the bed
mesh = { gmsh = "meshes/froya.msh" }
# mesh = { grid = { bbox = [8.0, 63.6, 9.2, 64.0], nx = 120, ny = 60 } }
order = 2
projection = "auto"               # local transverse Mercator about the centre

[bathymetry]
source = "data/froya_topobathy.tif"  # GeoTIFF, NetCDF grid, or a ROMS grid file
land_mask = "gshhs:f"                # optional, when the raster has no land
min_depth_m = 0.05

[physics]
coriolis = "latitude"             # per node, or { f_plane = 1.31e-4 }
friction = { manning = 0.025 }
wetting_drying = true

[[boundary]]
tag = "open"                      # or "auto": the sides that cross water
condition = "characteristic"
external = { tides = { atlas = "data/froya_atlas.nc" } }
# external = { nesting = { parent = "data/norkyst.nc", band_km = 2, band_minutes = 30 } }

[forcing.atmosphere]
source = ["data/meps.nc"]
pressure = true
inverse_barometer = 0.6

[output]
directory = "output/froya"
fields_minutes = 60
stations = "stations.toml"
```

`[vertical]` (3D), `[waves]`, `[particles]` and `[farm]` are optional sections that switch the solver up.

## For the ROMS community

- **Reading ROMS inputs:**
  - the grid file (`h`, `mask_rho`, `lon_rho`/`lat_rho`) as bed and land mask;
  - the tidal forcing file (`tide_period`, `tide_Eamp`/`Ephase`, `tide_Cmax`/`Cmin`/`Cangle`/`Cphase`, as made from TPXO/FES by the usual tools) as a `TidalAtlas`;
  - boundary and climatology files (`zeta_west`, `ubar_west`, …) as a parent. `OceanModelReader` reads NorKyst's history files today.
- **Writing ROMS names** in the output (P5.2), so existing post-processing works.
- **`docs/coming-from-roms.md`:**
  - map `ocean.in` keywords to case keys (`DT`/`NTIMES` → `run`, `LBC` → `[[boundary]]`, `RDRG`/`Zob` → `friction`, `TNU2` → viscosity);
  - say plainly what has no equivalent yet.
- **A test case ROMS users know,** run from a case file and compared against ROMS: an idealized estuary or a tidal channel with an analytic bed. It doubles as the README quickstart, with no download, and as a CI smoke run.

## Order

1. P8.1: the schema and the binary for the 2D path (mesh, bed, Coriolis, friction, still/harmonic/atlas/nesting boundaries, atmosphere, NetCDF output, stations), with an idealized case and a CI smoke run.
2. P8.2: move `froya_real_data` onto it in stages (2D tides, nesting, 3D, waves, farm), deleting the options from the example as they go; Frøya and Bodø as case files. The 2026-06-12 nested scores (3.0 cm Bodø, 4.2 cm Mausund) must reproduce bit for bit at each stage.
3. P8.3 to P8.5: ROMS inputs, ROMS output names, the "coming from ROMS" doc and the README quickstart.

## P8.1, first part: the case layer and `dgcom` (2026-11-07)

- **In the crate:**
  - `src/case/` holds the schema (`schema.rs`), the loader with `--set` overrides (`mod.rs`) and the builder and runner (`run.rs`).
  - `src/bin/dgcom.rs` provides `run` and `check`.
  - `serde`, `toml` and `serde_json` are plain dependencies, not behind a feature, so CI's `parallel,simd` builds test the case layer too. All three were already in the lock file through other crates.
- **What a case holds:**
  - mesh: a rectangle with a tag per side, or a Gmsh file;
  - bed: a uniform depth or a linear ramp;
  - physics: gravity, Coriolis (`f_plane`, or `latitude` as an f-plane), Manning or quadratic-drag friction (point-implicit), constant or Smagorinsky viscosity, wetting and drying (`froya_real_data`'s positivity limiter and `WetDry`);
  - initial: still water at a level;
  - boundaries: one `[[boundary]]` per open tag (`open`, `tidal`, `river`). Each is a `CharacteristicOBC` with still water or a harmonic tide, nodal-corrected when `run.start` is given;
  - output: `.dgsnap`, VTK, NetCDF (with the feature) and `stations.csv`.
- **Strictness:**
  - A mesh with open faces and no `[[boundary]]` for their tag is refused, as is a `[[boundary]]` whose tag the mesh doesn't have, and a station outside the mesh. All three are refused before the run.
  - Unknown keys fail at parse time. Without overrides, the error carries its line.
  - A Gmsh physical group the case layer can't name (a `Custom` tag) is an error, not a wall.
- **Boundary velocity, found while testing:**
  - A level-only external state takes the velocity outside as zero (`ElevationOnly::AtRest`, the library's default). A tide given as A at the boundary then enters as an incoming wave of A/2, so the boundary's level equals A only at an antinode of a standing tide.
  - That is documented in `src/boundary/characteristic.rs`, but a case author would not expect it, so `[[boundary]] velocity = "at_rest" | "incoming_wave"` makes the choice explicit. The example states it in a comment.
- **Gates (`tests/case_test.rs`, 2.8 s in the CI profile):**
  - The shipped example runs, 2 h of it, and its resolved case reads back equal.
  - A frictionless channel 60 km long and 10 m deep, closed at its head, with M2 of 0.1 m at its mouth. Linear theory gives an amplitude of 2 a_in cos k(L − x) along the channel. The model gives:

    | Boundary velocity | Mouth, model (m) | Mouth, theory (m) | Head, model (m) | Head, theory (m) | Phase difference |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | `at_rest` | 0.0690 | 0.0690 | 0.1000 | 0.1000 | 0.00° |
    | `incoming_wave` | 0.1381 | 0.1381 | 0.2000 | 0.2000 | 0.01° |

  - Plus the refusal cases above and ten unit tests of the schema: defaults, unknown keys and sections, exactly-one choices, overrides, JSON, the resolved round trip, the ramp.
- **The example:** `cases/tidal_channel/case.toml` is a channel 40 km long and 4 km wide, its bed going from 30 m down to 2 m above mean sea level, with M2 1.0 m, S2 0.35 m, Coriolis at 63.5°N and Manning 0.025. 25 h runs in 11,503 steps and 7.4 s (release build, `parallel,simd`). The time step falls to 0.08 s on the drying flats.
- **Not yet in a case:** bed rasters and projections, atlas tides, nesting, the atmosphere, 3D, waves, particles, farms, restarts and `dgcom mesh`. These are the remaining P8.1 lines in `TODO.md`, then P8.2.

## P8.1, second part: placed meshes, bed rasters, the production numerics (2026-11-07)

- **Placing a mesh:**
  - `mesh.geographic` (a bbox with nx × ny) meshes the box as a rectangle in the `LocalProjection` about its centre, with open sides, as `froya_real_data` does.
  - `mesh.origin` places a rectangle or a Gmsh mesh: its x = y = 0 is that point.
  - Only a placed mesh takes a raster, `coriolis = "beta_plane"` (f₀ and β of the centre's latitude, at y = 0) and stations by lon/lat. Validation refuses these without a placement.
- **Bed rasters** (`[bathymetry.raster]`):
  - `kind = "bathymetry"` is `BedRaster::from_geotiff`: dry and no-data pixels are land, with a GSHHS `coastline` mask at 4 × 4 cells per pixel if one is given.
  - `kind = "topobathy"` is `BedRaster::elevation_model`, then `fill_holes` with `fill_zero_holes`, then `clamp_land(land_elevation_m)`.
  - The crop window is the geographic box, or the mesh's lon/lat extent plus 2 %. A raster that misses the mesh is an error, not a panic.
  - The raster reaches the nodes `projected` (the default, at the raster's resolution) or by `point`. Isolated wet nodes are then raised, and the bed is smoothed if `smooth_rx0` is set.
  - `mesh.drop_land` (default true) then drops the elements with no node below mean sea level. `cases/tidal_channel` sets it false, since its flats above mean sea level flood.
- **Numerics:** `froya_real_data` ran SSP-RK(4,3) at 0.9 × the linear CFL limit, while the first part had SSP-RK3 at CFL 1. The case defaults are now the same as the example's:
  - `integrator = "ssp_rk43"`;
  - `cfl` from `linear_cfl_swe_2d × LINEAR_CFL_SAFETY`, e.g. 1.359 at order 2. `case.resolved.toml` writes it out;
  - `local_time_stepping_levels` (`Multirate`).

  The standing-wave gate gives the same four digits under the new defaults.
- **Stage 0 of P8.2: bit for bit against `froya_real_data`.**
  - `cases/froya/case.toml` states the example's defaults: `FROYA_BBOX`, 120 × 90, P2, the 50 m topobathy model with its zero holes filled and land capped at 5 m, f = 1.31e-4, Manning 0.025, M2 0.8 m at rest-velocity with a 1 h ramp, and 10-minute outputs, which equal the example's callbacks. Callbacks shorten the step to land on them, so the outputs must match for the steps to.
  - Against `froya_real_data tides=none hours=1 snapshot_minutes=10 station_minutes=10 rest_hours=0`, `snapshot_compare_3d` finds **0 values differing** (η, u, v at every node) in all 7 frames: 1,740 steps each, dt 0.798–2.073 s.
  - On the coastline-fitted `froya_coast.msh` (`mesh=`, with the case's `gmsh` + `origin` at the box centre), 0 values differ over 0.5 h: 12,101 wet elements, 5,889 steps.
  - The domain logs agree too: 5,183 zero pixels filled, a 1,180 × 891 raster at 50 m with 85.5 % water, 33 isolated wet nodes raised, 9,912 of 10,800 elements kept.
  - The atlas tides and nesting, the example's real modes, are the next stage. Until they are in a case, no option can leave the example.
- **Gates (`tests/case_test.rs`):** a synthetic topobathy GeoTIFF of a bay is written in the test, with a sloping bed, land beyond 8.133°E and an island. It is meshed geographically, with the beta plane, Manning friction, open sides and a lon/lat station.
  - A lake at rest over it stays at rest to |u| ≤ 6.8e-14 m/s and |η| ≤ 1.4e-14 m over 1 h, and to 6.6e-14 and 2.1e-14 with local time stepping and SSP-RK3.
  - A raster that misses the mesh, and a station on dropped land, are refused. Three unit tests cover what needs a placed mesh.

## P8.1, third part: tidal atlases (2026-11-07)

- **`[boundary.atlas]`:** a `TidalAtlas` file (the text format of `norkyst_boundary_tides`) projected onto the tag's boundary nodes (`TidalAtlas::boundary_tides`), nodal-corrected from `run.start`, ramped over `ramp_hours`.
  - It needs a placed mesh and `run.start`, since atlas lags are Greenwich lags. Validation refuses it without them.
  - An atlas with currents gives the external velocity. One without them takes `boundary.velocity`.
- **Coverage:** before the boundary is built, `BoundaryCoverage::of_atlas` walls the open faces with a node farther than `coverage_m` (default 5 km, `froya_real_data`'s `ATLAS_COVERAGE`) from an atlas point. More than `max_closed` (default 0.05, the example's `max_closed`) of the tag's faces is an error, as in the example. The domain's notes record how many faces were closed.
- **Options:** `correction = "theory"` (`TidalAtlas::infer_from_theory`: K2 and P1 at their equilibrium ratios, the minor semidiurnals by admittance) and `transport_scaling` (`BoundaryTides::with_transport_scaling`, the example's `tide_transport`). The gauge correction, the example's default `gauge_gains`/`gauge_ratios` from a gauge record and a station atlas, is not in yet.
- **Stage 1 of P8.2, bit for bit:** `cases/froya` with the atlas against `froya_real_data gauge_gains= gauge_ratios= hours=1 snapshot_minutes=10 station_minutes=10 rest_hours=0` gives **0 values differing** in all 7 frames: 12 constituents at 1,139 boundary nodes, 0 of 381 faces closed, 1,740 steps each.
- **`cases/bodo`:**
  - `bodo_coast.msh` with `origin` at the centre of 13.7–14.55°E, 67.05–67.5°N, the 50 m topobathy and the NorKyst atlas.
  - The domain: 11,118 of 11,344 elements kept, 905 zero pixels filled, 26 isolated wet nodes raised, 0 of 186 open faces closed. 1 h runs in 15,059 steps, 97 s.
  - It takes the beta plane at Bodø's latitude. `froya_real_data` applies Frøya's f = 1.31e-4 there, 2.6 % below Bodø's 1.345e-4, so this case is not compared bit for bit with the example.
- **Gates (`tests/case_test.rs`):**
  - An atlas holding one tide (M2, S2, K1) at every point forces the same tide as `tide` with those constants: the largest difference at the stations over 6 h is 7e-15 m on a tide of up to 0.39 m. This checks that the two routes share the nodal corrections and the Greenwich-lag convention.
  - An atlas covering the lower quarter of a mouth walls the rest, leaving 2 open faces, when `max_closed` allows it, and is refused at the default.
  - A unit test checks that an atlas needs a placed mesh and a start.

## P8.1, fourth part: the gauge correction (2026-11-07)

- **Into the library:** `froya_real_data`'s default atlas correction moved to the library, so the example and case files share one path.
  - `HarmonicAnalysis::fit_gauge_record` is the whole-record fit of `HarmonicAnalysis::GAUGE_RECORD` (M2 … M6 plus Mf, Mm and Ssa), Rayleigh 1, with P1, K2, N2 and Q1 at equilibrium where the record cannot separate them.
  - `TidalAtlas::correct_at_gauge(fit, source point, gains, ratios)` scales `gains` by the gauge-over-source complex ratio, then re-infers `ratios` with the gauge's ratios. It returns `GaugeAdjustment`s, whose `Display` is the example's log line.
  - The example's `corrected_atlas` now calls it. Its release binary from before the change and after it give 0 differing values over 7 frames (1 h, default options), with the same seven adjustments logged.
- **`[boundary.atlas.gauge]`:** `record` (a gauge file with its position), `source` (a station atlas from the atlas's model), `max_offset_m` (3 km, the example's `STATION_MAX_OFFSET`), `gains` (K1, O1, S2) and `ratios` (N2, Q1, P1, K2).
  - A source without a point near the gauge is an error. The example instead skips the gains with a message.
  - It is exclusive with `correction = "theory"`.
- **Stage 1b of P8.2, bit for bit:** `cases/froya` with the Mausund correction against `froya_real_data hours=1 snapshot_minutes=10 station_minutes=10 rest_hours=0` (its default tide) gives 0 values differing in all 7 frames: K1 × 0.875, −8.6°; O1 × 1.052, +17.2°; S2 × 0.939, +0.1°; N2 = 0.208 × M2; Q1 = 0.434 × O1; P1 = 0.271 × K1; K2 = 0.283 × S2.
- **A finding at Bodø:** `cases/bodo`'s correction scales NorKyst's O1 by 0.589 (+18.4°) and lags K1 by +16.5°, which `froya_real_data`'s Bodø runs share.
  - NorKyst's median O1 ratio over the 17 gauges is 1.00 (`notes/norkyst-issues.md`), so this is suspect.
  - The station-atlas point is 25.5 m deep with zero current. TODO P1.5.
- **Gates:**
  - A unit test of `correct_at_gauge`: the gauge's M2 at the source point, the same gain elsewhere, K2 at the gauge's ratio, and the errors.
  - A case test with a synthetic year-long gauge record (M2 1.2×, +10°; S2 0.9×, −5° over the model) and a synthetic source atlas. The case logs M2 × 1.199, +10.0° and S2 × 0.900, −5.0°; the 0.1 % on M2 is the fit's nodal treatment over the year. A source with no point near the gauge is refused.
  - A 30-day synthetic record without K2 failed this at first. The fit infers K2 at equilibrium from S2 where 30 days cannot separate them, and a record lacking K2 then biases S2 (0.944, +15°). Real records have K2; the test uses a year.

## P8.1, fifth part: nesting (2026-11-07)

- **`[boundary.nesting]`:** `froya_real_data`'s 2D nesting (`norkyst=`) in a case file, on the library's `OceanModelState`. The domain build does what the example's `Domain::nesting` and `correct_parent_tides` do, in the same order:
  1. Read the parent (`OceanModelReader::from_file`; the `netcdf` feature. Without it the case is refused with that reason).
  2. The datum: `level_m`, else minus `TidalAtlas::mean_level` of `atlas` (the raw atlas, as the example), else `ParentDatum::RecordMean`, which refuses records shorter than 29 days.
  3. Wall the open faces the parent has no water near (`BoundaryCoverage::of_parent`, `max_closed`).
  4. Sample the parent at the boundary and the band, then blend the bed (`blend_bathymetry` with `blend_shore_depth_m`, the example's `-WALL_LOW_WATER` = 2 m).
  5. Correct the parent's tide by (corrected − raw) atlas, from theory or at a gauge (the `[boundary.atlas.gauge]` code), within `atlas_coverage_m` + the band.
  6. Check the parent covers the run.
  - The run adds the band (`OceanModelState::relaxation`) as a source after the Coriolis force, as the example does, and the boundary is `CharacteristicOBC` on the parent (`velocity` applies only to a parent without currents).
- **Stage 2 of P8.2, bit for bit:** `cases/froya/nested.toml` against `froya_real_data norkyst=data/froya_norkyst.nc hours=1 snapshot_minutes=10 station_minutes=10 rest_hours=0`, 0 values differing in all 7 frames, for `nest_tides=corrected` (the gauge section), `raw` (without it) and `theory` (`correction = "theory"`). Both logs agree on the datum (+0.282 m), 1139 boundary nodes (16 snapped), 19084 band nodes, 16804 blended nodes, the seven gauge adjustments and the correction's largest term (N2 0.147 m; L2 0.019 m for theory, whose atlas has K2 and P1 at the equilibrium ratios: the case notes it as the example does).
- **Not yet the scored runs:** the 2026-06-12 runs (`output/p34_2026-06-12/run.sh`) also used `slopes3d=on`, whose bed treatment (3D rx0 smoothing, cliff shores raised to land, tidal ponds filled) case files do not have. That, and `ib=` with the atmosphere, are what is left of the 2D path (TODO P8.1).
- **`cases/bodo/nested.toml`:** builds on `data/bodo_norkyst_3d.nc` (datum +0.288 m, no walls, 579 boundary nodes, 17433 band nodes). It takes the beta plane, so it is not the example's run.
- **Gates** (`tests/case_test.rs`, with the `netcdf` feature; a synthetic parent written with the `netcdf` crate):
  - `a_nested_channel_fills_to_its_parents_level_less_its_mean`: a parent at ζ = 0.3 m with `level_m = -0.1`, and again with an atlas of `Z0` = 0.1: the channel's head settles at 0.2000 m, its volume within 5 % of 0.2 m over the channel. Without either, the 8 h record is refused for the datum.
  - `a_parent_that_misses_the_boundary_or_the_run_is_refused`: a parent cut 5 km east of the mouth (`max_closed`), and a 2 h parent for a 3 h run.
  - `the_bed_is_blended_to_the_parents_across_the_band`: the parent's 20 m on the boundary, the case's 10 m beyond the 3 km band, in between at 1.5 km, and 10 m everywhere with `blend_bed = false`.
  - Unit (no NetCDF): `nesting_needs_a_placed_mesh_a_start_and_an_atlas_to_correct`, the defaults and the value checks.
