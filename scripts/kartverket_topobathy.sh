# Fetch Kartverket's national topobathy terrain model (land heights and sea
# depths in one seamless grid) as a GeoTIFF in longitude/latitude (EPSG:4326),
# for `dg_rs::io::GeoTiffBathymetry` / `BedRaster`.
#
# Source: the WCS "Topobaty nasjonal detaljert terrengmodell 25833"
# (https://wcs.geonorge.no/skwms1/wcs.hoyde-dtm-nhm-topobathy-25833), free,
# served by hoydedata.no, which reprojects to EPSG:4326 on request. Values
# are bed elevations in metres, positive up (land heights to depths).
#
# Resolution: the service has two levels. At cells of about 42 m and coarser it
# serves the 50 m model, land and sea interpolated together. Finer requests
# get the 1 m level, which has depths only inside surveyed projects and the
# flat water surface (0) elsewhere, so this script refuses cells < 50 m
# (measured 2026-09-26: square cells of 40 m get the 1 m level, 42 m the 50 m
# model).
# One request is at most 3840 x 2160 pixels.
#
# Vertical datum: land heights are NN2000 (within 2-24 cm of mean sea level
# at the Norwegian tide gauges). The seamless model has to share one datum,
# so the sea part is taken to be NN2000 too; the service documentation does
# not state it (see TODO.md P1.6).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/kartverket_topobathy.sh <min_lon> <min_lat> <max_lon> <max_lat> [cell_m=50] [out]
#
# Example (the Frøya-Smøla-Hitra domain at about 50 m, 1 request):
#   ./scripts/kartverket_topobathy.sh 8.0 63.6 9.2 64.0 50 data/froya_topobathy.tif
