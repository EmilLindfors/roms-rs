//! Frøya–Smøla–Hitra: tides on real bathymetry.
//!
//! The 2D production path (`Simulation` + `SSPRK3` + `SWEPhysics2D`) with the
//! wet/dry defaults: the `WetDry` split form, HLL, positivity limiting, velocity
//! desingularization, point-implicit Manning friction, and the positivity CFL.
//!
//! 1. **Domain.** A bed raster (`BedRaster`): Kartverket's topobathy model
//!    (`dem=`, land heights and depths in one 50 m grid) when present; else
//!    the GeoTIFF bathymetry (0 at its dry pixels) with a land mask from
//!    GSHHS, four times finer, where the bed is `land_elevation`. The raster
//!    is L2-projected onto the nodes of a rectangular grid
//!    (`Bathymetry2D::project`; `bed=point` samples it at the nodes), and only elements
//!    with a node below mean sea level are kept (`Mesh2D::retain_elements`);
//!    their faces to dropped elements are coastline walls. Land nodes inside
//!    kept elements are dry shore for `WetDry`. The sides of the rectangle
//!    are open where they cross water.
//! 2. **Lake at rest.** Walls everywhere, no forcing: the largest spurious
//!    current and surface error after `rest_hours` (exact balance keeps both
//!    at round-off; the collocated scheme reached m/s on steep beds).
//! 3. **Tides.** A characteristic open boundary (`CharacteristicOBC`) forced
//!    by NorKyst-800 boundary tides (`BoundaryTides` from the tidal atlas
//!    `tides=<file>`, made by `examples/norkyst_boundary_tides.rs`: η, ū, v̄ of
//!    10 constituents plus P1 and K2, varying along the boundary), on a
//!    `ModelClock` starting at `start`. `tide_transport=3` scales the atlas
//!    velocity to carry NorKyst's transport over the child's bed, by up to a
//!    factor 3 (`BoundaryTides::with_transport_scaling`; off by default). Coriolis, Manning friction, optionally
//!    wind and an atmospheric pressure gradient (with the inverse-barometer
//!    level at the open boundaries): uniform (`wind`) or from a weather model
//!    (`met=<file,…>`: MET Nordic, MEPS, AROME-Arctic or ERA5 NetCDF, e.g.
//!    from `met_forcing_subset`; `GriddedAtmosphere2D`, ramped like the tide).
//! 4. **Nesting** (`norkyst=<file>`, e.g. from `norkyst_nesting_subset`):
//!    instead of the atlas tides, NorKyst-800's hourly ζ, ū and v̄ at the open
//!    boundary (`OceanModelState`: tides plus the coastal current and the
//!    wind-driven flow), with the velocity scaled to conserve the parent's
//!    transport, a relaxation band `band_km` wide with timescale
//!    `band_minutes` at the boundary, and the bed blended to NorKyst's across
//!    the band (`blend=0` to keep it), ramped up from rest over `ramp_hours`.
//!    Open faces NorKyst does not cover become walls. NorKyst's ζ is shifted
//!    by minus the mean level `Z0` of the boundary atlas (its datum sits
//!    0.28 m below mean sea level here), or by `nest_level=`. NorKyst's
//!    `gauge_gains` and `gauge_ratios` constituents are replaced by the
//!    gauge-corrected ones (below) by adding the difference between the
//!    corrected and the raw atlas, which is NorKyst's own harmonic fit, so
//!    the residual flow is kept (`OceanModelState::with_tidal_correction`;
//!    `nest_tides=raw` to keep NorKyst's tides). The parent ζ is taken as is; `ib=1` adds the
//!    inverse-barometer level of `met=` to it (for a parent run without
//!    pressure forcing).
//!    Without an atlas: M2 of `M2_AMPLITUDE` in one phase along the boundary.
//!    NorKyst-800 has too little N2 here (0.027 m at Mausund against 0.156 m
//!    observed) and about twice the Q1, its diurnals are off (K1 1.14×,
//!    +8.6°; O1 0.95×, −17.3° at Mausund) and its S2 is 1.065×. The atlas is
//!    corrected with the first gauge's whole-record fit (`TidalAtlas::infer`):
//!    `gauge_gains=K1,O1,S2` (the default) scales each by the gauge's
//!    constant over NorKyst's at the gauge (`station_atlas=`), keeping
//!    NorKyst's spatial structure; then `gauge_ratios=N2,Q1,P1,K2` (the
//!    default) re-infers N2, Q1, P1 and K2 from M2 and the corrected O1, K1
//!    and S2 with the gauge's ratios. Over 15 days at Mausund this takes S2
//!    from 1.10× to 1.00× of the gauge (K2 is not separable from S2 in a
//!    15-day fit, so the boundary's K2 matters as much as its S2).
//! 5. **Validation.** Every `station_minutes` the surface and the
//!    depth-averaged current (east/north) are sampled at the tide gauges
//!    `gauges=` (files as written by `scripts/kartverket_gauge.sh`) and at
//!    the current records `currents=` (ADCP file format, depth-averaged). The
//!    DG polynomial is evaluated at the station itself (`PointLocator2D`,
//!    `Probe2D`) if its element is submerged (every node at least
//!    `STATION_MIN_DEPTH` deep), else at the nearest point of a submerged
//!    element: a coarse mesh leaves perched pockets in shoreline elements
//!    that hold water above the tide. After the run
//!    each station's series are written to the output directory
//!    (`station_*.txt`, `currents_*.txt`). Currents are fitted for tidal
//!    ellipses and compared with NorKyst-800's (from the velocity constants
//!    of `station_atlas=`; each gauge gets a second station at its nearest
//!    atlas point, where NorKyst's currents apply) and with the record's, by
//!    constituent and by the complex difference |ΔW|, plus time-series
//!    skill against the record. For the surface, the part after
//!    `spinup_hours` is fitted for reference constants and compared with the
//!    gauge (its whole record fitted, which also supplies the ratios of the
//!    constituents the run is too short to resolve) and with NorKyst-800 at
//!    the gauge (`station_atlas=`, from `norkyst_boundary_tides points=`):
//!    amplitude ratio, phase difference and complex difference per
//!    constituent, and RMSE against the observations and against the gauge's
//!    tidal prediction.
//!
//! Without the data files it runs a synthetic basin with an island and a
//! beach.

//!
//! `waves=N` (N > 0) times N steps of the spectral wave model on the domain
//! instead of the tidal run (`wave_grid=frequencies,directions`, refraction
//! capped at `turning=` rad/s, or refraction and frequency shifting stepped
//! implicitly with `implicit=1`): the step, what sets it, and the cost per
//! model hour. With
//! `wave_mesh=NX,NY[,ORDER]` the waves run on an NX × NY grid of their own (P1
//! by default) over the same bed, and the coupling to the run's mesh
//! (`WaveCoupling2D`) is built and each exchange timed. `wave_hours=H` runs on
//! after the timed steps to H model hours; the sea at every node is then
//! written to `<output>/wave_nodes.txt`, and `wave_reference=<file>` compares
//! it node by node with an earlier run's (H_s by depth, T_m01, the mean
//! direction): how a step or a scheme changes the sea.
//!
//! `wave_coupling=MINUTES` runs the waves with the 2D tide, two-way coupled
//! every MINUTES (`CoupledWaves2D`, `Simulation::run_with_exchange`; a
//! multiple of `station_minutes`): the waves take the tide's level and
//! current, and give it their radiation-stress force (linear in time across
//! each interval) and Soulsby's enhancement of its Manning friction, both
//! ramped up over `ramp_hours`. On the run's mesh, or on `wave_mesh=`. The
//! sea `wave_sea=HS,TP,FROM` (JONSWAP, H_s in m, T_p in s, coming from FROM
//! degrees) comes in through the open boundaries and fills the domain at the
//! start. The wind of `met=` blows on the waves too, per wave node and not
//! ramped (`GriddedAtmosphere2D::on_mesh`, `CoupledWaves2D::with_gridded_wind`);
//! without it, the uniform `wind`.
//! Every output interval a line of the waves (the largest H_s, the mean over
//! water ≥ 3 m deep, the largest force, the mean wave step and its cost, and
//! what sets the step where) comes before the tide's. Use `implicit=1`: the
//! tide's currents over the shallows otherwise set the waves' step by
//! frequency shifting (0.6 s against the geographic 7 s at 1 km).
//!
//! `wave_sources=wam` integrates the sources as WAM does: implicit in the
//! DIA's diagonal, with Hersbach & Janssen's growth limiter proportional to
//! the step (`SourceIntegration::Implicit`, `GrowthLimiter::Rate`), in place
//! of SWAN's frozen rates and per-step limiter; `wave_integration=frozen|implicit`
//! and `wave_limiter=ris|rate|rate2` set either part alone (`rate2`: the
//! limit on the losses too, as ecWAM; breaking stays outside it). Its sources tolerate long
//! steps, so `wave_substeps=N` runs them once per N propagation steps (each
//! with its own implicit refraction, shifting and breaking), and `wave_cfl=`
//! sets the propagation's CFL number (0.5).
//!
//! `wave_land=absorbing` (the default) lets dry land take the waves, as the
//! coast does (`WaveModel2D::with_absorbing_land`). `wave_land=floored` treats
//! it as water of the minimum depth instead, where the waves pile up until the
//! sinks there remove them.
//!
//! `wave_depth_limit=1` (the default) scales each wave node's spectrum down
//! after every step to `H_rms ≤ γ d`, breaking's `H_max`
//! (`SourceTerms::with_depth_limit`): on the 1 km wave grid, nodes in a few
//! decimetres of water next to deep ones otherwise hold metres of H_s, which
//! Battjes–Janssen's saturated dissipation cannot remove. `wave_depth_limit=0`
//! leaves them. The waves' line reports the largest `H_s/d` and how many
//! nodes are at the limit, by depth. At the end of the run the sea at every
//! wave node goes to `<output>/wave_nodes.txt`, and `wave_reference=<file>`
//! compares it node by node with an earlier run's, as with `waves=N`.
//!
//! `wave_force=dissipation` (the default) drives the circulation by the
//! momentum the waves' sinks take over a wave step
//! (`WaveForceForm::Dissipation`, Dingemans et al. 1987): the wave-driven
//! currents and the setup where the waves break, without the set-down, and
//! without the unresolved shoaling's `−∇·S` that drove 6–10 m/s along the
//! cliff coasts in the 2025-10-09 storm. `wave_force=stress` takes the
//! radiation stress's divergence instead.
//!
//! `wave_spectra=<file>` takes the sea from a parent wave model instead:
//! MET Norway's MyWave WAM 800 m spectra at its points
//! (`examples/met_wave_subset.rs` fetches the latest forecast's points
//! around the domain; `io::WaveSpectraFile`). Each open-boundary node of the
//! waves takes the inverse-distance mean of its `wave_neighbours` nearest
//! points, regridded onto the waves' grid and linear in time, at every wave
//! step (`waves::BoundarySpectra`); the waves start from the boundary's mean
//! spectrum everywhere and take the parent's wind (the mean of its points',
//! `waves::WindSeries`), unless `met=` gives them the weather's. The run's clock (`start=`) must fall in the file's
//! times. Every output interval our H_s at the parent's points is printed
//! against the parent's, and at the end the bias and RMSE after twice
//! `ramp_hours`, with the series in `<output>/wave_points.txt`. For a
//! storm with its weather, fetch MET Nordic for the same days
//! (`met_forcing_subset`) and pass it as `met=`.
//!
//! `levels=N tide3d=1` runs the tide in 3D instead (`tidal_run_3d`, TODO P1.3):
//! the 2D run's open boundary (NorKyst nesting with `norkyst=`, else the atlas
//! tides) drives the barotropic mode, and with `norkyst=` the same file, read
//! with its profiles (`norkyst_nesting_subset profiles=1`), gives the initial
//! T and S at every node, the initial velocity's shear (NorKyst's profile
//! less its depth mean: the tide's depth mean ramps up from rest), and nests
//! u, v, T, S in the band (`Nesting3D`, `OceanModelColumns`); without it the
//! open faces relax to the stratification at rest (the summer pycnocline).
//! The PGF, the tracer limiter and the vertical advection take the domain's
//! mean initial profile as their reference. GLS k-ε, log-layer bottom drag
//! (no 2D Manning friction), Smagorinsky viscosity; the vertical advection
//! beyond an explicit Courant number implicit
//! (`Hydrostatic3D::with_implicit_vertical_advection`). `wind` and `met=` as
//! in 2D: the pressure gradient on the 2D module, the wind stress on the
//! columns (`GriddedAtmosphere2D::split_for_3d`). The stations, the progress
//! lines and a 3D snapshot file (`snapshot_minutes=`,
//! `SnapshotWriter::create_3d`) as in 2D; `dt_3d=` caps the step and
//! `cfl_3d=` sets its Courant number (`Hydrostatic3D::compute_dt`; 1.5).
//! Measured on the Mausund tide (3 h, nested, 2026-10-10): 2 holds and 3
//! blows up within 0.8 h (a 50 m element during the ramp, at 25 s steps);
//! against 0.5, 1 moves ū by 0.3 mm/s RMS and 2 by ≤ 3 mm/s, T by 0.013
//! and 0.019 °C RMS (565 → 246 → 148 s per model hour). Use
//! `slopes3d=on` for the stratified rest state on steep beds.
//!
//! A long 3D tide can stop and resume bit for bit. `restart_hours=H` writes
//! `<output>/<domain>.restart` (`Restart3D`, replaced in one rename, so a
//! crash while writing keeps the previous one) at the first progress line at
//! or after every H model hours. It holds the state, the mode splitter's slow
//! forcing, the vertical reference, the station records and the sampling
//! counters. `resume=<file>`, with the same other options (the domain's
//! fingerprint is checked), builds the run as before from its initial state,
//! then continues from the file's time to `hours=`: the snapshot file drops
//! the frames written after the restart and goes on, and the stations' report
//! covers the whole run. A resumed run's outputs equal the uninterrupted
//! run's, byte for byte.
//!
//! `levels=N` (N > 0) times `steps_3d=` (10) mode-split steps of the 3D model
//! on the domain instead of the tidal run: N surface-stretched σ-levels, GLS
//! k-ε, log-layer bottom drag, Smagorinsky viscosity, the Kuzmin limiter, a
//! summer pycnocline at rest. It reports the baroclinic step and what sets it
//! (and what local time stepping in 3D could save), the barotropic substeps,
//! and the wall time per step and per model hour. `dt_3d=` overrides the step;
//! `debug_3d=` takes comma-separated switches for diagnosing the 3D model on
//! the real bed: `trace` (the largest speed and where, every step, and the
//! momentum tendency at rest), `uniform` (no stratification), `linear`
//! (linear in z instead of the pycnocline), `balanced` (the initial state as
//! the PGF's balanced reference), `nolimiter`, `constant` (constant mixing
//! instead of GLS), `thin=D` (the 3D thin-column depth, 0.1 m by default),
//! `vcentred` (centred vertical tracer advection), `nu=V` (a constant
//! horizontal viscosity of the shear, m²/s, added to Smagorinsky's),
//! `around=K:R` (only the elements within R m of element K, walls around:
//! a local growth reproduced in minutes), `every=N` (trace every N steps),
//! `dump=PREFIX` (the state at rest, `gap=N` steps before the end and at the
//! end, for `scripts/mode3d_dump.py`), `seed=PREFIX:AMP` (start from rest
//! plus a dumped mode at a largest speed of AMP m/s), `perturb=A` (a
//! deterministic random T perturbation of up to ±A/2 °C at every wet point,
//! so that modes with e-foldings of hours show within a run rather than
//! after round-off has grown for a day), `deep=G` (°C/m below
//! the pycnocline, 0.002), `vadv=centred|akima|tvd|upwind|hermite` (the
//! vertical tracer scheme), `noref` (that scheme without the reference of
//! the state at rest, which 3D runs take by default; TODO P1.3),
//! `tadv=none|centred` (the turbulence's advection) and
//! `export=PATH` (with `around=`: the patch as a test fixture).
//!
//! `snapshot_minutes=N` (N > 0) also writes the state every N minutes to
//! `<output>/froya.dgsnap` (`io::SnapshotWriter`: f32 η, u, v per node, with
//! the mesh, bed, clock, stations and projection), a tenth of the VTU frames'
//! size. The viewer replays it without rebuilding the domain, with the land
//! around it from the elevation model:
//! `cd viz && cargo run --release -- --replay ../output/froya/froya.dgsnap`.
//! With stations, N is rounded to a multiple of `station_minutes`.
//!
//! `rx0=r` smooths the bed, keeping its volume, until the slope factor
//! r_x0 = |h₁ − h₂|/(h₁ + h₂) between neighbouring nodes at least
//! `rx0_min_depth` (3 m) deep is at most r (`Bathymetry2D::smooth_rx0`):
//! shoals a node wide otherwise carry spurious m/s currents.
//!
//! `wall_land=lower` lowers the land at the walls of a coastline mesh
//! (`mesh=`) in elements that are otherwise water to the water beside it
//! (`Bathymetry2D::lower_wall_land`): the simplified coastline leaves a strip
//! of the elevation model's land a fraction of a node spacing wide in front
//! of two thirds of its walls, and every element with such a strip is partly
//! dry at every water level. Only elements wet off their walls below the
//! lowest water (2 m below MSL) are lowered. Off by default.
//!
//! `slopes3d=on` (for 3D runs, `levels=N`; in a 2D run it shows what the 3D
//! bed does to the tide) smooths the bed, keeping its volume,
//! until no element's depth range lets a σ-level cross the summer
//! pycnocline between two of its nodes (`Bathymetry2D::smooth_element_slopes`,
//! TODO P1.3): within an element r_x0 ≤ 0.15 (`slopes3d=r` for another bound)
//! between columns that are not thin (`debug_3d=thin=`, 0.1 m) wherever the
//! deeper one is below `free_depth` (19 m, the pycnocline's bottom).
//! Shores need none (the 3D wetting and drying moves their layers on the 2D
//! kernel's subcells) and do not move. Off by default.
//!
//! `bbox=west,south,east,north` runs a smaller box, e.g. the 22 × 19 km
//! around Mausund (a quarter of the cost), with its own mesh and boundary
//! atlas (use `tide_transport=3` there): see "Mausund sub-domain" in
//! `docs/gmsh-meshes.md`.
//!
//! `lts=N` (N > 0) steps the tidal run with local time stepping
//! (`Multirate`, up to N levels of halved time steps): every element at
//! the largest power-of-two fraction of the step its own CFL allows.
//!
//! `rk=43` (the default) steps with SSP-RK(4,3), `rk=3` with SSP-RK3. The
//! positivity bound of the wet/dry scheme sets the step where elements may
//! run dry, and SSP-RK(4,3)'s SSP coefficient of 2 doubles it for 4/3 of the
//! RHS work per step. The bound is relaxed per element by how its water is
//! distributed, up to `cfl=`, by default 0.9 of the integrator's linear
//! stability limit (`linear_cfl_swe_2d`: 1.36 at P2 with SSP-RK(4,3)), and
//! in shoreline elements up to 0.9 of the subcells' lower limit
//! (`linear_cfl_subcells_swe_2d`: 0.99 at P2).
//!
//! Harmonic validation needs the record after spin-up to resolve the main
//! constituents: 15 days separate M2/S2 and K1/O1 (`hours=384` with the
//! default spin-up); N2 needs 28.
